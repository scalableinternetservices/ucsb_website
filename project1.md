# Project 1: Learning Ruby with RubyKoans

The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common
functions and libraries.

[RubyKoans page](http://rubykoans.com/).
You will need to download the project, run the script as
`ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb` to see which file to change next in order to
make the tests pass. Once you update all the required files and all 282 tests
pass, upload the result to GitHub and fill in the submission form below.
