# Primary Project

## Objective

The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience in building and
deploying a scalable web service on the Internet. Using the latest web
technologies while learning how to tackle the scalability and fault-tolerance
concerns. This is a "learn by doing" course: the course project will form the
primary focus of the course with the lectures and discussion of research papers
providing background material. Each project will be conducted in an agile team
where students will build their own scalable, redundant web site using
fundamental web technologies and the Ruby on Rails framework.
