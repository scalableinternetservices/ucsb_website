# History

> When was HTTP created?

--

The year is 1990. The Internet has existed for ~20 years, email for ~8.

Tim Berners-Lee has the idea to combine __HyperText__ and the __Internet__. He
creates the first version of __HTTP__ and __HTML__.

__HyperText__: Links documents together via __HyperLinks__

> When was the first web browser created?

--

* 1993: Mosaic, the first web browser, is created at UIUC

* 1994: Marc Andreessen leaves UIUC and founds Netscape with Jim Clark

---

# The First Web Server

![The First Web Server](first_web_server.png)

---

# HTTP Explained

In its original, simplest version:

* Open a TCP socket (standard port is 80)

* Send an ASCII request for a resource (`GET mypage.html`)

* Response comes back containing only the content of `mypage.html`

* Close the TCP socket

--

HTTP was originally designed to:

* Send HTML (was later extended to send anything)

* To facilitate interaction between a web browser and a web server (now also
  used heavily for server-to-server communication)

# HTTP Request/Response Components

---

# HTTP Request

* __Method/Verb__: What do you want to do (e.g., __GET__, __POST__)

* __Resource__: What is the logical path of the resource you want

* __HTTP Version__: What version of HTTP are you using?

* __Headers__: Standard way to specify or request optional behavior

* __Body__: Content that is being sent to the server (e.g., a file upload)

---

# HTTP Response

* __HTTP Version__: Indicates the HTTP version the server is "speaking"

* __Status Code__: Indicates success, failure, or other possible [response
  codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)

* __Headers__: Provides meta data about the response.

* __Body__: The primary payload of the response (for a successful _GET_
  request, this contains the resource content)

---

# HTTP Components Example

![Components of HTTP request and response](http_components.png)

---

class: center inverse middle

# HTTP Methods/Verbs

---

# GET

* Request a copy of a _resource_

* The request should have no side-effects (i.e., doesn't change server state)

* __GOOD__: `GET /fluffy_kitty.jpg`

* __BAD__: `GET /users/sign_out`

---

# POST

* Sends data to the server

* Generally used to create a _resource_

* Has side-effects (e.g., creates a resource)

* Not idempotent (i.e., making the same request twice creates two
  separate, but similar resources)

  * "Do you want to submit your form again?"

  * "Please do not refresh this page."

---

# PUT

* Sends data to the server

* Often used to update an existing resource

* Has side-effects

* Should be idempotent (e.g., updating a resource twice should result in the
  same effect to the resource)

---

# DELETE

* Destroys a resource

* Has side-effects

* Should be idempotent

* __GOOD__: `DELETE /session/<id>` (for log out)

---

# HEAD

* Exactly like GET but excludes the body in the response

> When might you want to use HTTP HEAD?

???

* To check if a resource exists
* CHeck the size of a resource
* To check if a resource has changed (last-modified)

---

# HTTP Method/Verb Misuse

Correct HTTP method/verb usage is not enforced, and is often misused.

> What do you think the following is supposed to do?

```http
GET /post/5?action=hide
```
???

Common Problems:
* Using GET for actions that change server state
* Using POST for idempotent actions
* Using PUT for creating resources
* Using DELETE for non-idempotent actions
* Using GET to send data to the server, not prohibited but not recommended

--

> What other problem do you think can occur with the misuse of HTTP methods/verbs?

---

# Other HTTP Methods/Verbs

* CONNECT

  * Establish a connection through a proxy server

* OPTIONS

  * See which methods/verbs are available for a resource

  * Used for [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) requests

* TRACE

  * Used to reflect the HTTP request back

---

# HTTP Resource

Specifies a logical hierarchy to access a resource:

* __GOOD__: `/gp/product/1565925092/`

* __BAD__: `/index.jsp?page_id=4251`

--

## Query String

* The portion of the resource after a _question mark_ (`?`)

* Used to assist in locating the resource

* Values are assigned using the equal token (e.g., `sort=top`)

* Multiple values can be concatenated via _ampersand_ (`&amp;`)

> What do you think the following returns?

<https://www.reddit.com/user/spez/?sort=top&amp;t=all>

---

# HTTP Version

Version strings are often used in protocols to make it easy to evolve the
protocol.

With HTTP different versions have different behavior:

* (1991) HTTP 0.9 (retroactively versioned): Single line protocol with no
  headers. Only __GET__ supported: `GET index.html`

* (1996) HTTP 1.0: Added headers, and a version string

* (1999) HTTP 1.1: Connection keep-alive by default, additional caching
  mechanisms. __Primary HTTP version used today__

* (2015) HTTP 2.0: Binary framing, header compression, many other
  optimizations. Discussed in more detail in a future lecture

* (2022) HTTP 3.0: QUIC/UDP. Lower latency. Packet Loss.
  Discussed in more detail in a future lecture.

# HTTP Headers

---

# HTTP Headers Overview

Provides metadata for the request and response.

HTTP Header keys are case _InSenSiTiVe_.

> What HTTP headers do you know of?

---

# HTTP Headers: Accept (request)

Indicates the desired format of the requested resource.

```http
Accept: text/html
```

I desire the resource in html format.

```http
Accept: application/json
```

I desire the resource as a JSON document.

```http
Accept: application/json,application/xml
```

I prefer a JSON document, but an XML document will do.

---

# HTTP Headers: Content-Type (request/response)

Indicates the format of the request or response body.

```http
Content-Type: text/html
```

The body of this request/response is an HTML document.

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

The body of this request/response is a JSON document.

Other common request content-types:

* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (HTTP form)
* `multipart/form-data` (HTTP form with file upload)

---

# HTTP Headers: Accept-* (request)

## Accept-Encoding

Indicates preferred encoding for the response body.

```http
Accept-Encoding: bzip2,gzip
```

I prefer the data compressed via bzip2. If that cannot be done, please gzip the
response.

## Accept-Language

Indicates the preferred language for the resource

```http
Accept-Language: es,en-US
```

I prefer Spanish, but will accept US-English.

---

# HTTP Headers: Host (request)

Indicates the DNS hostname associated with the desired resource.

Required in an HTTP 1.1 request.

> Why is the HOST header required?

--

Compare the responses to the following:

```bash
curl -I http://185.199.109.153 --header 'Host: cs291.com'
curl -I http://185.199.109.153 --header 'Host: square.github.io'
curl -I http://185.199.109.153 --header 'Host: zwalker.github.io'
```

---

# HTTP Headers: User-Agent (request)

Indicates information about the client (web browser, crawler, tool) to the web
server.

```http
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.99 Safari/537.36
```

Can be used to serve different content to different clients. However, try to
avoid doing so.

---

# HTTP Headers: Set-Cookie, Cookie

## Set-Cookie (response)

A response header informing the browser to use the provided cookies in
subsequent requests to the server.

## Cookie (request)

A request header containing the data previously set by the server via a
`Set-Cookie` header.

--

> What kind of information might one put in a cookie?

--

> What security concerns may exist with cookies?

???

Uses of cookies:
* Authentication
* Session state
* Personalization
* Tracking
* User preferences
* Shopping cart
* Advertising
* Analytics

Security concerns:
* Cross-site scripting
* Stolen cookies (stolen session)


---

# Other HTTP Headers

## Caching Related Headers

* ETag
* Date
* Last-Modified
* Cache-Control
* Age

## Security Related Headers

* Content-Security-Policy
* Strict-Transport-Security
* X-Frame-Options

`X-` prefixed headers are not part of the official specification and may later
become _standardized_.

???

* ETAG - Entity Tag, a unique identifier for the resource used for caching
* Date - Date of the response
* Last-Modified - Date the resource was last modified
* Cache-Control - Cache control directives, used to indicate boundaries of caching (e.g., no-cache, max-age)
* Age - Age of the resource in the cache

* Content-Security-Policy - specifies where resources can be loaded from
* Strict-Transport-Security - Forces the browser to use HTTPS
* X-Frame-Options - Prevents the resource from being embedded in an iframe

# HTTP Statuses

---

# HTTP Statuses Overview

The HTTP response status indicates the outcome of the request. Status codes
fall into one of five categories:

* 1XX - Informational
* 2XX - Successful
* 3XX - Redirection
* 4XX - Client Error
* 5XX - Server Error

Ref: [HTTP Status Code Definitions](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-status-codes)

---

# Common HTTP Statuses

* __200 OK__: The requested resource is being returned.

* __301 Moved Permanently__: The resource has been moved and the browser should
  always use the new URL provided via the `Location: https://...` header.

* __302 Found__: The resource can be found at another location via the
  `Location` header.

* __304 Not Modified__: When request includes a cache header (e.g.,
  `If-Modified-Since`) this status indicates the content hasn't changed saving
  resources from being fetched, rendered, and sent.

* __403 Forbidden__: The request is not authorized to access the resource.

* __404 Not Found__: The resource does not exist.

* __500 Internal Server Error__: Something unexpected happened on the server.

* __503 Service Unavailable__: Temporary failure on the server-side possibly
  with an upstream server.

---

# HTTP Request Body

HTTP PUT and POST requests typically have a body associated with them. HTML
_form_ elements usually result in a POST request with a `x-www-form-urlencoded`
type.

Example:

```bash
curl --trace-ascii - -X POST "http://postman-echo.com/post" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
--data 'username=bboe&comment=Hi There'
```

```http
POST /post HTTP/1.1
Host: postman-echo.com
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
accept: application/json
Content-Length: 33
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=zwalker&comment=Hi There
```

---

# HTTP Response Body

The body of a response usually contains the requested resource content.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Try it! Direct Input Server

## Listen for a TCP connection

```bash
nc -l localhost 5000
```

## Browse to: <http://localhost:5000>

## Paste the following into your terminal

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 111

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <h1>HTTP is easy!</h1>

```

__Note__: Ensure the newline gets copied between the headers and the body.

# HTTP Performance

Prior to HTTP 1.1, one TCP connection was used for a single HTTP request.

> What performance flaws exist in this design?

---

# TCP Connection Delay

Establishing a TCP connection requires 1 round-trip.

![TCP round trip visualized](tcp_round_trip.png)

Image Source: “High Performance Browser Networking,” by Ilya Grigorik

---

# Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance

The early phases of a TCP connection are bandwidth constrained.

.center[![TCP congestion mechanisms](tcp_congestion.png)]

Image Source: “High Performance Browser Networking,” by Ilya Grigorik

---

# TCP Congestion Window Size (cwnd)

It takes a fair amount of time to get up-to-speed. Making new connections per
HTTP request is not terribly efficient.

.center[![TCP connection window size](tcp_cwnd.png)]

Image Source: “High Performance Browser Networking,” by Ilya Grigorik

---

# HTTP Keep-Alive

HTTP 1.1 officially added support for the `Connection` header most commonly
used as:

`Connection: keep-alive`

In fact, with HTTP 1.1, the default is `keep-alive`. The alternative, and the
way to signal the end of the HTTP session is:

`Connection: close`

With a keep-alive HTTP session, the server waits some amount of time for
an additional request after processing the most recent request.

---

# HTTP Keep-Alive Session

.center[![HTTP Session with Two Requests](http_session.png)]

Image Source: “High Performance Browser Networking,” by Ilya Grigorik

---

# HTTP Pipelining

With HTTP keep-alive, we can make multiple requests on a single TCP connection. Success!

But, we're still waiting for the current response before we can issue the next
request. Why wait?

---

# HTTP Pipelining Session

.center[![HTTP Session with Two Requests](http_pipelining.png)]

Image Source: “High Performance Browser Networking,” by Ilya Grigorik

---

# Think About it

> What sort of issues might occur with HTTP pipelining?

---

# Pipelining Issues

## Head of Line Blocking

Head of line blocking means that a request that takes a long time is blocking
another request from occurring.

--

## Extra work for the server

Pipeling may require the server to buffer future responses while blocked on the
head of the line. These extra resources can exhaust the server.

Furthermore, if an error occurs the server may end up doing the same _work_
twice.

--

## Adoption

Many intermediaries (proxies, caches) simply do not support HTTP pipelining thus
making the feature less appealing.

---

# More Speed

A single web page may have tens or even hundreds of resources. In practice obtaining each
resource serially over the same TCP connection is too slow.

> What can be done to get more speed?

---

# Concurrent HTTP Sessions

Most browsers will open up to __six__ concurrent TCP connections to the same
server.

.center[![Concurrent HTTP Sessions](concurrent_http.png)]

Image Source: “High Performance Browser Networking,” by Ilya Grigorik

---

# Even more speed

According to the HTTP Archive the average number of resources for websites they
crawled is `~100`. With up to six connections each HTTP session must fetch
approximately `16` resources. With head-of-line blocking this may still be too
slow.

> What can we do?

---

# Domain Sharding

_Domain sharding_ is the process of separating resources to different
domains, e.g., `i.ytimg.com`, `s.ytimg.com`.

The web browser will make up to `6` connections for each domain.

Reduces page load time for some work-loads (test to see if it's right for you).

---

# Hacks that work

Concurrent TCP sessions and domain sharding are hacks to get more performance
out of an existing system (HTTP/1.1).

Using these hacks makes application development and deployment more
complicated.

## Other Performance Related Hacks

* CSS/JS concatenation and minimization

* Image spriting

## Is there a better way?

HTTP/2 solves some of these problems, but not all

---

# Chrome Network Table Revisited

Does this table make sense now?

.center[![Chrome Network Table](developer_tools_waterfall.png)]

???

Stop here for demo of chrome developer tools and network tab:

Visit a website and open the developer tools. Look at the network tab

* /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --user-data-dir="/tmp/no_http_3_profile"
* chrome://flags/
* /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --user-data-dir="/tmp/no_http_2_profile" --disable-http2

# HTTP/2

---

# HTTP/2 History

* Google internally announced the SPDY protocol (Nov 2009).

* Google released SPDY in Chrome for (Sept 2010).

* Google deployed SPDY on all their servers (Jan 2011).

* Twitter deployed SPDY on its servers (March 2012).

* Apache added support for SPDY (April 2012)

* NGINX added support for SPDY (June 2012)

* Firefox added support for SPDY (June 2012)

* First draft of HTTP/2.0 based on SPDY (Nov 2012)

* RFC 7540: HTTP/2.0 published (May 2015)

---

# HTTP/2 Features

* Multiplexing application streams permits concurrent streams over a single TCP
  connection with the ability to prioritize streams.

* Header compression minimizes request and response overhead.

* Server push provides a way for the server to send responses prior to
  receiving a request for the associated resource.

--
  * In practice server push has been effectively "retired"
    (https://developer.chrome.com/blog/removing-push)

---

# Remember Concurrent Connections in HTTP/1.1

With HTTP/1.1 we would open up to 6 connections per domain to load resources faster.

.center[![Concurrent HTTP Sessions](concurrent_http.png)]

Image Source: “High Performance Browser Networking,” by Ilya Grigorik

--

.center[Now we can use a single connection with concurrent streams]

---

# HTTP/2 and Dropped Packets

.center[
![HTTP/2 with dropped packet](http2_dropped_packet.png)
]

HTTP/2 provides excellent multiplexing support. However, any dropped packet
blocks the entire connection.

TCP cannot differentiate between packets dropped by different streams.

---

# TCP Retransmissions

.center[
![TCP Retransmissions](tcp_retransmissions.png)
]

Losing packets results in retransmissions. In high latency networks this
process is painfully slow.

---

# HTTP/3 and QUIC


QUIC is an attempt to use UDP for HTTP.

QUIC's primary goal is to reduce latency.

In fact, you are already using QUIC on many intenet scale services

---

# QUIC and Application Layer TCP

* What's wrong with TCP?

--

* TCP requires a round trip to the server before HTTP requests can begin.  Because of 3 way handshake to establish a connection

* TCP is the reason we have head of line blocking in HTTP/2 even with multiple streams

* UDP is connection less - no handshake

* UDP doesn't care about packet order

---

# QUIC and Packet Loss

.center[
![QUIC Multiplexing](quic_multiplexing.png)
]

Packet loss affects only the stream that lost the resource.

No global head-of-line blocking.

TCP handles packet loss through retransmissions. QUIC can handle _some_ packet
loss without retransmission.

> How?

---

# QUIC Results

* 75% of requests avoid handshake

* Google search observed a 3% reduction in mean page load time.

* The slowest 1% of users experience a 1 second reduction in page load time.

* YouTube users experience 30% fewer rebuffers.

Overall the most significant results occur under poor network conditions.

(October 2020) 75% of Facebook traffic is over QUIC [[ref](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/10/21/networking-traffic/how-facebook-is-bringing-quic-to-billions/)]


---

# HTTP/3

HTTP/3 is proposed as HTTP over QUIC.

https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/quic/RLRs4nB1lwFCZ_7k0iuz0ZBa35s

HTTP/3 specification (June 2022)

- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114

Abstract:

> The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable in a
  transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control, and
  low-latency connection establishment.  This document describes a mapping of
  HTTP semantics over QUIC.  This document also identifies HTTP/2 features that
  are subsumed by QUIC, and describes how HTTP/2 extensions can be ported to
  HTTP/3.
