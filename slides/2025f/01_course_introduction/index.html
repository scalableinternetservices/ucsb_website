# Internet (or Web) Services

Each of the previous problems can be solved by a variety of Internet services.

Every day billions of people use various Internet services to solve such
problems.

> What other every day problems are solved by Internet services?

> Do services use other services?

---

class: center inverse middle

# As an Internet service grows in popularity, supporting the increased amount of Internet traffic results in increased complexity of the Internet service

---

# Internet Services, what's that?

- What are the characteristics of an internet service?

.center[![Question Mark](question_mark.jpg)]

---

# ...Internet Services, what's that?

There are many application-level protocols that are used to build out Internet
Services.

For this class, Internet services will refer to HTTP-based services.

The interface to your web service may be the web browser (e.g., Chrome,
Firefox), an API client (via REST, GraphQL, etc), or both.

---

# Scalable, what does that mean?

.center[![Question Mark](question_mark.jpg)]

---

# ...Scalable, what does that mean?

An Internet service is scalable if increasing demands can be effectively met
with increasing capacity.

Demands could be:

* Web traffic quantity (typical association)

* Dataset size

---

# Effectively meet demands: Explanation

* Internet service remains available

* Response time does not excessively degrade

## Think about it

You have a web service designed to run on a single server. What do you do when
you can no longer effectively meet demand.

__Is your solution scalable?__

# Is Scalability of Web Services a Solved Problem?

---

# The Fail Whale Era

- Startups in the 2000s–2010s often **collapsed under sudden growth**
![Twitter Fail Whale](fail-whale.webp)

---

# Examples
- Twitter’s *Fail Whale* (2007–2013)
- Reddit/Digg outages
- Netflix scaling pains pre-cloud migration
--

- Common issues:
  - DB bottlenecks
  - No elastic infra
  - Weak caching/CDN

**Learn more:**

- [2010 - The beginning of netflix cloud migration](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/four-reasons-we-choose-amazons-cloud-as-our-computing-platform-4aceb692afec)
- [2016 - Netflix Cloud Migration Story](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/completing-the-netflix-cloud-migration)


???

Speaker Notes:  
This is the “pain” context. Show how scaling was the existential bottleneck.  
Students should recognize that outages were *commonplace* when demand spiked.  
Emphasize the mismatch between fast user growth and limited infra tooling.

# The Rise of Cloud-Native Infrastructure

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Cloudflare_Logo.svg" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin: 10px;">

- Last 15 years saw **commoditization of scaling tools**
--

- Key developments:
  - Cloud elasticity (AWS EC2 → Lambda, GCP Bigtable, DynamoDB)
  - Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)
  - Global load balancers & CDNs (Cloudflare, Akamai)
--

- Scaling = **one API call away**

???

Speaker Notes:
Here’s the contrast — cloud vendors made infrastructure scaling “boring.”
No more hand-rolling load balancers or racks of servers.
The point: we moved from “scaling as art” to “scaling as service.”

# The Big Question

--

## If cloud makes scaling easy…
### Is scalability a solved problem?

--

Discuss in pairs/groups.

**Framing resource:**
- [Martin Kleppmann on Distributed Systems Tradeoffs](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/e03bf12d-1718-4ab5-b990-75a26c1056e4?authuser=2)

???

Speaker Notes:
Pause and let students *argue this out*.
Encourage them to think: “Solved for *what*?” Infrastructure? Data? Cost?
This primes them for the nuance in the next slide.

---

# Solved vs. Unsolved

- **What’s solved**

  - Architecture patterns (monolithic, microservices, message queues, job frameworks)
  - Elastic infra (autoscaling groups, serverless)
  - Traffic distribution (CDNs, load balancers)
  - Observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus)
  - Standard practices (caching, sharding)
  - Infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)

--

- **What’s not solved**

  - Choosing the right architecture pattern (tradeoffs between complexity and cost and ease of development)
  - Cost efficiency at scale
  - Distributed data latency vs consistency tradeoffs
  - Workload diversity (AI inference, IoT, real-time collab)
  - Operational pitfalls (retry storms, hot keys, backpressure)

???

Speaker Notes:
Stress the phrase: *“scaling is commoditized but not free.”*
Students should understand the patterns are known, but tradeoffs remain.
Use examples: Cloud bills blowing up, retries melting down Kafka, etc.

---

# Why This Still Matters to You

- **Architectural basics still matter**
  - Caching, partitioning, async processing = foundations of cloud services
--

  - **Code still matters**
      - Inefficient queries, algorithms, and hot loops still sink systems
--

- **Judgment still matters**
    - Multi-region, consistency vs latency, cost vs performance


???

Speaker Notes:
Close by motivating them:
- Cloud gives you the *tools* but not the *wisdom*.
- You need the historical context to know which tool to use when.
- Code-level efficiency + architectural tradeoffs = still YOUR responsibility.

# Course Skills

__This course is fairly demanding, but is one of the most industry-applicable
courses you can take.__ You will develop the following skills:

* Programming in __Ruby__

* Building web services using the __Rails__ framework

* Working with __Docker__

* Experience with Amazon Web Services (__AWS__): __EC2__, __Elastic
  Beanstalk__, __Lambda__, __S3__

* Load testing Internet services via __Tsung__, and __ab__

* __Agile__/__Scrum__ software development

* Development using __Git__ with a _feature-branch_ flow via __github__ _pull
  requests_

---

# This course is _not_

a deep-dive into:

* Cloud Computing

* Distributed Systems

* Networking

* Relational Databases

* Security

But we will touch on all of the above.

---

# Industry Focused

The skills you should develop through this course are the same that I use
everyday at work.

The projects will all be open source so if you're proud of your team's work
(you should be) then put a link to the project on your résumé.

Industry related tools you will use:

* Git via Github (project source version control)

* React (frontend framework)

* Ruby on Rails (backend framework)

* AWS (cloud platform)

* Load testing tools (Tsung, ab, ...)

---

# What you will do

In this course you will learn and utilize some of the technologies behind
building large-scale Internet services.

You will test and support to the best of your abilities:

* Exponential growth in the amount of traffic to your web service

* Exponential growth in the dataset your web service relies upon

---

# In Summary

This course won't teach you how to build a web application that obtains
worldwide attention and usage.

However, this course will teach you how to build a web application __that can
respond to__ worldwide attention and usage.

---

---

# Why Ruby on Rails?

Ruby is an interpreted language, thus it is not terribly __fast__, nor is very
__memory efficient__.

However, it is very easily scalable, and for most Internet services, developer
time ($$$) is going to be much more significant than the efficiency of the
service.

Building Rails Internet services quickly with zero prior experience makes this
class possible.

Consistency in frameworks across teams allows us to better support each other.

# The Life Cycle of a Web Request

---

# Two Endpoints

--

A __web browser__ is a process (at least one) that runs on an operating system.

It-

* responds to user input

* renders the display

* utilizes the network

--

A __web server__ is a process (at least one) that runs on an operating system.

It-

* responds to network requests

* loads resources that may come from file system, database, other servers

---

# Web Request Life Cycle Group Exercise

Prompt: What _things_ (e.g., events, protocols, actions) (might) occur when
someone types [https://www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) in their web
browser and presses return.

## Part 1: ~10 minutes

Discuss in groups of four, and write down in-order the components you come up
with. Start generic, and leave space to provide additional detail for
sub-sequences.

## Part 2 (remaining time)

Collectively, we build a more definitive list using the whiteboard.

---

# Core Components of a Web request

* __Web server__: Opens a TCP socket to listen for requests

* __Browser__: Makes a DNS query to obtain an IP address for www.reddit.com

* __Browser__: Initiates a TCP connection to the IP address

* __Web server__: Accepts the TCP connection

* __Web server__: Adds TLS context to the TCP connection

* __Browser__: Wraps the TCP connection in a TLS session

* __Browser__: Sends an HTTP request over the TLS session

* __Web server__: Parses the request, fetches and sends the requested resources
