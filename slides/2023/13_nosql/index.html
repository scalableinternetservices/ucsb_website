# NoSQL Motivation

After today's lecture you will understand how NoSQL can be used to build
scalable Internet services.

NoSQL data stores are not likely to be part of your project, nevertheless,
after this lecture you should understand where you might use them in practice.

# Application Growth

.center[

![Database Symbol](database_symbol.svg)
![Database Symbol](database_symbol.svg)
]

As our application experiences greater and greater popularity, the data
layer proves difficult to scale horizontally.

Without a scaling path for our data layer, our growing data set and/or our usage
of the database will become a bottleneck limiting our application.

---

# Scaling Relational Databases

Relational Databases are great tools for our data layer. Unfortunately, there
is no simple way to spread load across multiple RDBMSes.

We've looked a ta few techniques for scaling RDBMSes:

* Distinguishing Reads from Writes

* Service Oriented Architectures

* Sharding

---

# RDBMS Scaling Limitations

> What if these techniques aren't sufficient for our application?

* We are already using read-replicas, and it's not enough.

* We've already broken our application out via SOA, and still have load
  hotspots.

* There's no good way to shard our application.

When relational databases fail to scale to our needs, we need to turn to
non-relational solutions.

# NoSQL

Non-relational databases are often referred to as NoSQL databases.

This is an umbrella term for many types of databases:

* Key-value stores

* Column-oriented data stores

* Document-oriented stores

* Graph databases
]

---

# NoSQL: Horizontal Scaling

.center[
![Database Symbol](database_symbol.svg)
![Database Symbol](database_symbol.svg)
![Database Symbol](database_symbol.svg)
]

Most NoSQL solutions are good at horizontal scaling.

In exchange for better horizontal scaling, NoSQL databases provide applications
fewer guarantees.

---

# NoSQL: Synchronizing Writes

.left-column[
![NoSQL Scaling](NoSQL-base.svg)
]
.right-column[
Let's say we want a database to span multiple machines.

We can send writes to both nodes, and the nodes will keep each other in sync.
]

---

# NoSQL: Write Conflicts

.left-column[
![NoSQL Scaling: Write Conflict](NoSQL-email.svg)
]
.right-column[
Let's say:

* We have two clients sending writes.

* There's a uniqueness constraint on the email field.

If both try to write the same email address to different rows, and the
databases can communicate, they can resolve the conflict in some manner.

For example: One succeeds, the other fails.
]

# NoSQL: Network Partitions

]

---

# NoSQL: Network Partitions

.left-column[
![NoSQL Scaling: Network Partition](NoSQL-partition.svg)
]
.right-column[
> How do we handle a network partition?

If the databases cannot communicate, they cannot determine if an update
violates database consistency.

Solutions:

* Allow the the write and hope for the best.

* Reject writes during a network partition.
]

---

# NoSQL: Network Partitions

.left-column[
![NoSQL Scaling: Network Partition](NoSQL-partition.svg)
]
.right-column[
If we allow both writes, our database is not __consistent__.

If we do not allow the writes, our database is not __available__.

If we only operate where network __partitions__ cannot occur, we are not a
distributed service.

# CAP Theorem

# CAP Theorem

.left-column[
![CAP](CAP.png)
]
.right-column[
Situations like these motivated the CAP Theorem.

Formalized by Eric Brewer, late 90s.

Theorem: You can have at most two of these properties for any shared-data
system.
]

---

# Consistent and Partition Tolerant

.left-column[
![CAP](CAP.png)
]
.right-column[
* Always consistent

* Can handle network partitions

* Not always available to clients

In the earlier example, a CP solution would not allow any writes.
]

---

# Available and Partition Tolerant

.left-column[
![CAP](CAP.png)
]
.right-column[
* Always accessible

* Can handle network partitions

* Not always consistent

In the earlier example, an AP solution would accept the conflicting writes.
]

---

# Consistent and Available

.left-column[
![CAP](CAP.png)
]
.right-column[
* Always accessible

* Always consistent

* Assumes no network partitions

A CA system would never get into the earlier scenario because it would not be
deployed where partitions occur.
]

---

# Partition (In)Tolerance

.left-column[
![CAP](CAP.png)
]
.right-column[
Assuming no partitions is very limiting:

* For high availability and latency reasons, supporting multiple data
  centers are desirable

* Even within a single datacenter, partitions occur

As a result, scalable Internet services require partition tolerance, and thus
have to choose between consistency, or availability.  ]

---

# ACID vs. BASE

The BASE acronym was created to describe these NoSQL solutions that make
tradeoffs between Availability and Consistency.

| ACID        | BASE                  |
|:------------|:----------------------|
| Atomicity   | Basically             |
| Consistency | Available             |
| Isolation   | Soft State            |
| Durability  | Eventually Consistent |

---

# Consistency

Consistency comes in many forms:

## Strong Consistency

* After update, everyone sees the updated value

## Eventual Consistency

* Eventually the system will converge on the updated value

* Read-your-writes consistency

  * Writer immediately sees written values

* Causal consistency

  * Writer, and those they communicate with, sees written values

* Session consistency

  * Within a session writer sees written values

N, W, & R are a useful shorthand for describing the read/write strategy of a
data store.

_N_ refers to the number of separate nodes that retain a copy of the data. Here
`N=5`.

When `W + R &lt;= N` no general guarantees can be made pertaining to
consistency.

## `3 + 2 &lt;= 5`
]

.right-column60[
When `W + R &gt; N` all writes are captured by .background-blue[at least one]
of the read nodes.

Any two size-3 subsets of five nodes must have an overlap.

## `3 + 3 &gt; 5`
]

---

# NWR: Strong Consistency

For strong consistency, many combinations can work.

## .background-pink[W=1], .background-green[R=N]

Write to any one node, consult all nodes on reads. Use the _newest_ value.

--

## .background-pink[W=N], .background-green[R=1]

Write to all nodes, consult any node on read.

--

## .background-pink[W=N/2 + 1], .background-green[R=N/2 + 1]

Write to a quorum, read from a quorum. Use the _newest_ value.

---

# NWR: Weak Consistency

For weaker notions of consistency, we choose `W + R &lt;= N`.

Sticky sessions can be used to implement __session consistency__, which is a
form of __read-your-writes consistency__.

* Use a cookie, or other information to ensure a single user talks to the same
node(s) for both reads and writes.

# NoSQL Stores

There are different types of NoSQL stores:

### Document-oriented stores

* We will look at MongoDB

### Key-value stores

* We will look at Redis

### Column-oriented data stores

* We will look at Cassandra

### Graph databases

* Specialized data stores, not always horizontally scalable
* We won't be looking at these

---

# ![MongoDB](MongoDB-Logo.svg)

.left-column[
![MongoDB Collection](crud-annotated-collection.png)
]
.right-column[
MongoDB is a Document-oriented data store.

* Stores "Documents" that are nested hash-like structures.

* These Documents are stored in "Collections" (similar to RDBMS table).

* Documents do not have fixed schema.

* Documents can have references to other documents.
]

.right-column70[
![Mongo Query](crud-query-stages.svg)
]

---

# ![MongoDB](MongoDB-Logo.svg) JSONB

Documents are stored in JSONB

* Binary version of JSON

* Can nest other JSON documents

---

# ![MongoDB](MongoDB-Logo.svg) Trade-offs

## Provides no notion of transaction

* Unit of atomicity is the Document

* Inserting multiple documents can fail individually

--

## No notion of joins

* Computation based on relations between documents must be done in the
  application.


---

# ![MongoDB](MongoDB-Logo.svg) Sharding

.left-column40[
Collections can be sharded.

* Each shard can have a replica set.

* Config servers manage the mapping between shards and data.

* Mongos routes queries to the appropriate shard.
]
.right-column60[
![MongoDB Sharded Cluster](sharded-cluster-production-architecture.svg)
]

---

# ![MongoDB](MongoDB-Logo.svg) Sharding

.left-column40[
Replica sets use asynchronous replication.

You can configure your driver to read from the primary only, or to read from
the read-replicas. Additionally, you can configure the number of nodes to write to.

* [Read Preference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-preference/)

* [Write Concern](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-write-concern/)
]

# ![Redis](Redis_Logo.svg) Overview

Redis is a key-value data store.

* Also called a data structure store

* Supports many data structures

  * Lists

  * Sorted Sets

  * Hashes

  * Bitmaps

* Primarily keeps data structures in memory

  * Persistence to disk is optional

---

# ![Redis](Redis_Logo.svg) Interface

* Each data type allows similar mechanisms to what you would do in memory.

* Access hashes by key

* Access lists by index

* Sorted sets can return top-K

* Push/pop on lists

---

# ![Redis](Redis_Logo.svg) Transactions

A series of commands can be executed within a transaction.

These transactions are atomic -- no other operations can occur during a
transaction -- however, failures do not rollback previous operations in the
transaction.

> Errors happening after EXEC instead are not handled in a special way: all the
  other commands will be executed even if some command fails during the
  transaction [[reference](https://redis.io/topics/transactions)].

In other words consistency is not maintained in the event of a failure.

---

# ![Redis](Redis_Logo.svg) Persistence

## RDF: Redis Database File

* Forks process and saves a dump

## AOF: Append Only File

* Saves updates to a log

* Log is replayed upon start

---

# ![Redis](Redis_Logo.svg) Sharding

.left-column[
![Redis Sharding](redis_sharding.png)
]
.right-column[
Redis cluster supports sharding.

* Single primary for writes

* Replicas for failover.
]

---

# ![Redis](Redis_Logo.svg) Sharding

.left-column[
![Redis Sharding with Failures](redis_sharding_failures.png)
]
.right-column[
Cluster can handle all reads if up to two nodes are down.

It's possible to read from replicas -- the default configuration sends all read
and write operations to the primaries.
]

---

# ![Redis](Redis_Logo.svg) Rebalancing

.center[![Redis Shard Rebalancing](redis_rebalancing.png)]

Redis cluster can also dynamically rebalance after adding hardware.

---

# ![Cassandra](Cassandra_logo.svg)

Of those discussed, most similar to a RDBMS.

Cassandra has table-like structures called ColumnFamilies.

* ColumnFamilies have many rows.

* Rows are like a big hash, with many keys and values.

  * Rows can be very long

* Rows are heterogeneous, and can be schemaless.


---

# ![Cassandra](Cassandra_logo.svg) Column Families

![Cassandra Static Column Family](cassandra_static_column_family.png)
__Static Column Family__


![Cassandra Dynamic Column Family](cassandra_dynamic_column_family.png)
__Dynamic Column Family__

---

# ![Cassandra](Cassandra_logo.svg) CQL

Interface is called CQL, similar to SQL:

```cql
SELECT * WHERE KEY=11194251 AND startdate='2016-11-08-0500';
```

Features are very limited:

* Most queries are key-value

* Secondary indicies are allowed

* Sorting is very limited

---

# ![Cassandra](Cassandra_logo.svg) Limitations

## No Transactions

* Atomic batches exist (with ~30% performance penalty)

* Non-atomic batches provide no isolation from other batches

## No Joins

* Join data in your application

---

# ![Cassandra](Cassandra_logo.svg)

* Cassandra is a primary-less system

* It is distributed and highly available

* Data is automatically split across nodes

* Reads are eventually consistent

  * Can be made strictly consistent on a per-statement basis

---

# ![Cassandra](Cassandra_logo.svg) Statement Consistency

```python
SELECT * WHERE KEY=11194251 ...
  CONSISTENCY LEVEL ONE     # (R=1)
  CONSISTENCY LEVEL ALL     # (R=N)
  CONSISTENCY LEVEL QUORUM  # (R=N/2 + 1)
  ```


```python
UPDATE ... WHERE KEY=11194251 ...
  CONSISTENCY LEVEL ONE     # (W=1)
  CONSISTENCY LEVEL ALL     # (W=N)
  CONSISTENCY LEVEL QUORUM  # (W=N/2 + 1)
```

---

# ![Cassandra](Cassandra_logo.svg) Distributed Keyspace

.left-column[
Cassandra distributes its keyspace across a virtual ring of nodes.

* This ring can be randomized, or ordered.

* Ordered allowes faster range queries.

* Randomized avoids hotspots.
]
