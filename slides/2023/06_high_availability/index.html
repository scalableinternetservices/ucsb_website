# Architecting for High Availability

## CS291A: Scalable Internet Services

---

# High Availability Motivation

Modern web applications power important parts of our lives

--

* Banking

* Medical

* Communications

--

Having access to these services (high availability) at any time is increasingly
important.

---

# Expressing Availability

Services advertise availability as a "number of nines":

* Three nines: 99.9% uptime, 525.6 minutes of downtime a year (43.8/month)

* Four nines: 99.99% uptime, 52.6 minutes of downtime a year (4.38/month)
    * Desired by many business applications

* Five nines: 99.999% uptime, 5.3 minutes of downtime a year (26.5s/month)
    * Desired by communication companies

Downtime usually only includes unplanned outages. Scheduled outages, no matter
how frequent, are usually not incorporated in marketing material.

# Measuring Availability SLIs/SLOs/SLAs

Service Level Indicators - SLIa
- In order to provide a HA service we need to agree on a metric
- Come up with a set of metrics that will measure and indicate availability
of your service

--

Service Level Objectives - SLOs
- Come up with with a list of goals based on metrics that you want to be achieved
by your service

--

Service Level Agreements - SLAs
- Making sure your clients can rely on your service to keep the agreed level
of availability and metrics

# What are possible causes of failures?

# Possible causes of failures. What if?

* a server process hangs?

--

* a server process dies?

--

* an application server fails?

--

* a load balancer fails?

--

* a switch fails?

--

* a router fails?

--

* a connection to the Internet fails?

--

* DNS fails?

--

* the Internet fails?

--

* a database fails?

--

* an entire data center fails?

# Single point of failure

Can we identify service components which failure would bring down the whole service?

# Handling Application Server Failure

.left-column40.center[
![Single application server](application_server.png)
]
.right-column60[
We've already discussed the components of this sort of failure.

* Process-level isolation reduces hanging, or dead processes by having other
  processes to pick up the slack.

* A process in an infinite loop may add unnecessary load to the server, so it's
  important to have monitoring to detect such issues.

* Having a load-balanced configuration permits failing servers (high load or
  dead) by having a pool of other servers to direct traffic to.

# How do we Handle Load Balancer Failure?

![Single load balancer](single_load_balancer.png)

---

# Redundant Load Balancers

.left-column40[
Use two load balancers.

One is the primary, and the other is the failover.

Load balancers communicate via a heartbeat to determine the health of each
other.

> During a failover, what happens to the IP address?


---

# Load Balancer Failover

When the failover load balancer determines it needs to become the primary
(detected via lack of heartbeat), it issues a gratuitous ARP for the load
balancer's IP.

The gratuitous ARP (layer 2) will inform the switch that traffic should be
delivered to the port that leads to the new primary (formerly the failover).

All new packets will be transparently delivered to the new primary load
balancer.

Established flows can be supported depending on how much information sharing
occurs between the load balancers.

---

class: center, middle

# How do we Handle Switch Failure?

![Redundant load balancers](redundant_load_balancers.png)


---

# Redundant Switches

Use two switches!

Again, both a primary and failover are necessary using a heartbeat between them.

During failover similar issues occur but layer 2 should be stateless so less or
even no synchronization is needed.

# How do we Handle Router Failure?

![Redundant switches](redundant_switches.png)

---

# Redundant Routers

Use two!

This includes a similar heartbeat and failover system, but is not as trivial to switch between.

# How do we Handle Access to the Internet Failure?

# How do we Handle Access to the Internet Failure?

Use two!

Use separate internet service providers (ISPs).

# Routing with Two ISPs

> How do we handle routing when we have two ISPs?

--

## Outgoing Traffic (easy)

We control how we send outbound traffic so we have some options:

* Pick the cheapest or most reliable link
* Pick the _closer_ link

--

## Incoming Traffic (hard)

We cannot inform clients by which path to reach our IP.

However, we can give hints by using BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to persuade
networks to prefer one path over another. (Path prepending, Community values)

An "A record" is an IPv4 address associated with a DNS host (AAAA for IPv6
addresses).

--

## Problem

The order of DNS responses with multiple A records is often not preserved by a
client's DNS server.

## Result

* For performance we want to send the browser to one data center.
* For availability we want to send the browser multiple A records.

We end up having to make a choice between performance and availability.

# Multi-site High Availability

![High Availability in Two Sites](dual_site_availability.png)

What about the database?

---

# Rate Limiting and Algorithms

- Prevent some users (mostly other services) from consuming too much of your resources
- Provide similar performance to all users
- Respond with status code 429 and appropriate header

--

## Popular rate limiting algorithms
- Fixed Window
- Sliding Window
- Leaky Bucket

- DataDog
