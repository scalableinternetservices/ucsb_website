# Separation of Responsibilities

> Why not use a single process to handle both the HTTP request and the
> application logic?

--

The concerns and design goals of HTTP servers are different from those of
application servers.

---

# Server Design Goals

## HTTP Server

* Provide a high performance HTTP implementation (handles concurrency)

* Be extremely stable, and relatively static

* Be very configurable and language/framework agnostic

--

## Application Server

* Support a specific language (e.g., Ruby), many of which are not optimized for
  performance

* Run _business logic_ which is extremely dynamic

---

# Application Servers

We are building web applications, so we will require complex server-side logic.

We _can_ extend our HTTP servers to provide this logic through modules, but
there are benefits to separating application servers into one ore more distinct
processes. Because:

--

* Application logic will be dynamic

* Application logic regularly uses high level (slow) languages

* Security concerns are easier (HTTP server can shield app server from
  malformed requests)

* Setup costs can be amortized if the app server is running continuously

---

# Application Server Architectures

> What architecture should we use for our application server?

--

We have the same trade-offs to consider as with HTTP servers (e.g. threads,
processes, and/or workers), so we needn't revisit them again.

# How does an HTTP Server communicate with the application server(s)?

---

# Inter-server Communication


## [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)

Spawn a process, pass HTTP headers as ENV variables and utilize STDOUT as the
response.

--

## [FastCGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI), [SCGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Common_Gateway_Interface)

Modifications to CGI to allow for persistent application server processes
(amortizes setup time).
