# Introduction to HTML

---

# HyperText Markup Language

Plain text language that uses SGML syntax with a defined set of _tags_.

* Mark-up is provided by nesting text and other mark-up between `<open_tag>`
  and `</close_tag>`
* Tags are nestable
* Some tags have key-value attributes

Example:

    !html
    <h1>Header 1</h1>
    <h3>Header 3</h3>
    <p class="intro">A paragraph with some <em>emphasized text</em>.</p>

---

# HTML Document

HTML documents single root-element _should_ be the `<html>` tag. It's forest of
children are referred to as the _Document Object Model_ or __DOM__.

Technically there should be only two children of an `<html>` tag:

`<head>`: Encapsulates meta-data about the page including its title, and
   references to external resources (CSS, JavaScript)

`<body>`: Encapsulates everything to be displayed on the page

__Note__: With HTML5 (and many browsers' parsers for other variations of HTML)
these first-level tags can be omitted as they can be inferred based on the tag
being parsed.

---

# HTML5 Bootstrap Example

    !html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>

        <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
      </head>

      <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

        <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>

---

# Common HTML Tags

Different HTML tags should be used for different elements on the page. There
exist a handful of formatting and style tags, however, those should be avoided
in-favor of using CSS (cascading style sheets) -- we will discuss CSS later.

* __h1__ through __h6__: various header-level tags (h1 should be page title)
* __p__: paragraph text
* __ul__, __ol__: unordered and ordered list wrapper
* __li__: list item (nested within ul, or ol)
* __table__: begin a table
* __tr__: begin a table row within a table
* __td__: one entry in a table row
* __span__: An inline grouping mechanism
* __div__: A block-level grouping mechanism

---

# Anchor Tag

The most innovative part about HTML is the __HyperText__ part provided by the
anchor tag: `<a>`

Using an anchor tag one can link to another document (resource) anywhere on the
web.

    !html
    <a href="http://cs291.com">CS291A</a>

---

# HTML Forms

An HTML form provides a convenient way to collect input from a web browser.

    !html
    <form action="/communities" method="post">
      <label for="cn">Name</label>
      <br>
      <input type="text" name="community" id="cn">
      <input type="submit" name="commit" value="Submit">
    </form>

## Notes

* `method` defaults to __GET__. Recall that __GET__ requests shouldn't
  have side-effects so __POST__ is more-often more appropriate.
* The default encoding is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

---

# Attributes `id` and `class`

HTML elements have two ubiquitous tags:

`id`: A unique identifier that makes it easy to find one element in the DOM

`class`: Multiple classes can be assigned to DOM elements, and the same class
can be applied to multiple DOM elements (many-to-many relationship).

    !html
    <span class="alert loud" id="flash_message">Error.</span>

DOM IDs and classes are very useful for applying CSS, and adding JavaScript
callback hooks to elements on the page.

---

# Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

---

# The `<style>` tag

Inside the HTML `<head>` section we can use the `<style>` tag to add CSS
directly to the HTML.

Here we are styling all `h1` tags.

    !html
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          h1 {color: blue;}
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </body>
    </html>

---

# Style via ID

DOM elements can be styled multiple ways.

Here we are styling all DOM elements with ID `header` (there should be at most
one per page).

IDs are prefixed with the `#` symbol in CSS.

    !html
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          #header {color: blue;}
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <span id="header">Hello World</span>
      </body>
    </html>

---

# Style via Class

Here we are styling all DOM elements with class `alert`.

Classes are prefixed with the `.` symbol in CSS.

    !html
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          .alert {color: red;}
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <span class="alert">Hello World</span>
      </body>
    </html>

---

# Inline Styles

We can use the `style` attribute on HTML tags to directly style
DOM elements.

    !html
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
         /* nothing added here */
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <span style="color: blue;">Hello World</span>
      </body>
    </html>

---

# Contradictory Styles

    !html
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          span {color: blue;}
          .a {color: yellow;}
          #b {color: green;}
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <span class="a" id="b" style="color: red;">Hello World</span>
      </body>
      </html>

> What color is Hello World?

---

# Simplified Rule Precedence

In general more specific rules have higher precedence than less specific rules.

Precedence order (highest first):

* `!important` rules (e.g., `span {color: blue !important};`)
* Inline style
* ID
* Class
* HTML Tag

It gets more complicated, but understanding these rules will go a long way.

---

# External Style Sheets

Style definitions are most often provided through separate CSS files, rather
than `<style>` blocks.

    !html
    <html>
      <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <span>Hello World</span>
      </body>
      </html>


> Why might external styles be better than using the `<style>` tag, or inline
> styles?

---

# Visually Powerful

CSS is incredibly powerful. Changing a site's stylesheet can completely impact
how the site's users interact with the site.

This ends the brief overview of CSS.

To get started, it's definitely recommended to use a CSS framework like
Twitter's Bootstrap: [http://getbootstrap.com/](http://getbootstrap.com/)

# Scarce Resources

Software Engineering requires judicious use of scarce resources.

YOU are one of those scarce resources.

Modern techniques are designed to optimize for your time.

## Modern Software Development Techniques

* Agile and Scrum
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Github work flow
* Pair programming (pairing)

---

# Understanding Agile

> ## Sprint 2: Starts October 12

> * Conduct a __retrospective__ on how the last sprint went and how your group
>   can improve.
> * Decide on a sprint commitment.
> * Implement stories from the current sprint.

Soon guidelines like the above should make complete sense to you.

# Agile and Scrum

> What is Agile software development?

__Agile__ is a collection of different approaches for developing software that
has emerged as dominant in the last ~15 years.

Agile has evolved: [Modern Agile](http://modernagile.org/).

__Scrum__ is a popular form of Agile software development.

---

# The World Before Agile

---

# Waterfall

The origin of the _Waterfall_ model is generally misattributed to Winston
Royce, from his paper: "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems"

In reality, he wasn't the first, and didn't advocate for what became Waterfall
software engineering.

Herbert Benington would be a more accurate attribution.

Reference: *1970, Proceedings of IEEE WESCON 26 (August): 1–9.

---

# Waterfall Diagram

![Waterfall](waterfall.png)

This diagram from Royce's paper is frequently cited.


---

# Waterfall Process

Each stage performs its role and then passes its deliverable to the next stage.

E.g., Design must be completed before coding, which in-turn must be completed
before testing.

Strength: This approach allows for deep specialization.

Waterfall works great for areas like manufacturing where it is _expensive_ to
alter the design due to issues detected in latter stages.

With software it's incredibly cheap to adapt the process along the way.

---

# Waterfall Continued

The Waterfall technique works best when you have complete knowledge. With
respect to software development:

* Software testers and developers know everything about how the software will
  be deployed
* Software developers have few if any _surprises_ during testing
* Designers have complete understanding of the difficulty of each design
  decision
* Requirements team understands the impact on design and development

In practice most of these items are not met, thus the waterfall model inhibits
the software development process.

---

# Agile Manifesto

In 2001, the “Agile Software Manifesto” was written by Kent Beck, Ken Schwaber,
Jeff Sutherland, and Dave Thomas.

## Agile Values

* __Responding to change__ over following a plan
* __Working software__ over comprehensive docs
* __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation
* __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools

---

# Responding to Change

... over following a plan

* Unexpected issues will occur during the product development.
* Responding to change involves deciding how to best proceed when such issues
  occur.

For example:

> What do you do when half your team is suddenly out sick?

> What do you do when a simple feature addition turns out to be
> significantly more complicated?

---

# Working Software

... over comprehensive documentation

## Agile

* Focus on deliverable features
* Automated acceptance, unit, functional, and integration tests

## Waterfall

* Extensive documented requirements (before any prototype)
    * Style guide
    * Commenting rules
    * Component interaction
    * User interface requirements

---

# Customer Collaboration

... over contract negotiation

![Three people looking at computer](stock_collaboration.png)

"Here's what we've got so far."

"Uh... Now that I see it in action, I've changed my mind."


![Software Developer](cartoon_programmer.png)

"I'm sure if I just build what they've asked for, they'll love it."


---

# Individuals and Interactions

... over processes and tools

![Rugby Scrum](rugby_scrum.jpg)

---

# Scrum

Scrum is a specific type of Agile software development.

It was developed in the early 1990s by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

We will use a stripped down version of Scrum for this class.

## Other Agile Alternatives

* __Kanban__: Focus on controlling WIP (work in progress), no __sprints__
* Extreme Programming (XP): Emphasis on feedback systems through automated
testing and pair programming


---

# Scrum Roles

## Product Owner

Understands the needs of the customer and prioritizes those needs.

## The Team

People building the software. Individual roles are intentionally vague.

## Scrum Master

Responsible for making sure the _Scrum_ process is followed and helps to resolve
blocking issues (e.g., between members of the team, with the product owner, or
with external dependencies)

__Note__: We will have neither a product owner nor scrum master on our teams.


---

# Scrum User Story Defined

A __story__ is a unit of functionality that exposes something new to the user
(customer). Stories are often written like:

> As a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I can \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, in order to
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

For example:

> As a github gold organization, I am permitted up to 50 private repositories,
> in order to privately maintain a large number of distinct projects.

> As an authenticated student user, I am able to post a question such that my
> instructor knows I am asking the question but my classmates do not, in order
> increase my likeliness of submitting questions.

---

# Scrum Sprint Defined

A __sprint__ is a specific length of time to accomplish some work.

Sprints may operate on the same schedule as product releases (e.g., 2-week
Sprints immediately followed by releasing whatever was accomplished) however,
it's not necessary.

---

# Scrum Process

![Scrum Process](scrum_process.png)

---

# Scrum Process

At the start of each sprint is the __sprint planning meeting__ to decide the
"sprint commitment".

Stories are pulled from the prioritized product backlog into the sprint
backlog. The team may decide to pull stories in a slightly different order
depending on various constraints. So _agile_.

The team decides how many stories to pull based on their prior estimate of
those stories' effort (done in _grooming_) relative to their current
_velocity_. Velocity is often the average amount of _work_ delivered over the
last three weeks.

After the sprint planning meeting the commitment is _frozen_ and the team works
through the sprint backlog for the duration of the sprint.

Each day the team has a __stand up__ meeting to discuss what is currently being
worked on, and to discover any _blocking_ issues.

---

# End of Sprint

A __sprint review__ is conducted at the end of the sprint to demo what was
accomplished. Everything considered completed should be ready to be released to
customers (also referred to as __shippable__).

Finally a __sprint retrospective__ is conducted for the team to reflect on how
well or poorly things went during the sprint. The team discusses how they can
improve their process and (hopefully) comes out of the meeting with concrete
idea to be acted upon in the next sprint.

---

# CS291 Scrum

We will use an adapted version of scrum:

* No product owner
* No scrum master
* At the start of each lab the team will conduct a retrospective
* Each team will demo their sprint's progress to me
* After the retro and demo the next sprint will begin and teams will choose
  their commitment
* Throughout the week each team will work to complete their commitment, and
  subsequently deploy their releasable code to AWS
