# Client-side Caching Motivation

We want our important application data persisted safely in our data center.

This data will be regularly read and updated by geographically distributed
clients.

Our access to the data needs to be fast.

# Response Time and Human Perception

| Delay         | User Reaction                |
| -------------:|:----------------------------:|
|   0 -  100 ms | Instant                      |
| 100 -  300 ms | Small perceptible delay      |
| 300 - 1000 ms | Machine is working           |
|      1000+ ms | Likely mental context switch |
|    10,000+ ms | Task is abandoned            |

# Multiple HTTP Requests per Page

![Total Requests Per Page](httparchive_requests_per_page.png)

Source: http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#reqTotal

---

# Caching

The fastest request is one that never happens.

__Cache__: a component that transparently stores data so that future requests
for the same data can be served faster

> Where can we introduce caching?

--

* Inside the browser

* In "front" of the server (CDNs, ISP cache, etc.)

* Inside the application server

* Inside the database (query cache)

---

# Client-side Caching

> How does the browser cache data?

--

> How does the browser know when it can or cannot use cached data?

--

The building blocks of caching are all provided via HTTP headers:

* cache-control
    * no-store
    * no-cache
    * max-age
    * public | private

* etag

* last-modified

* if-none-match

* if-modified-since

---

# cache-control: no-store

When `cache-control: no-store` is provided as a header to an HTTP response the
browser and intermediate proxy-caches:

* must not save the information in any non-volatile storage

* must make a best effort attempt to remove the information from volatile
  storage as promptly as possible

__Note__: The browser may retain a copy in memory (volatile storage) for use
with the browser's back/forward buttons.

Generally used for sensitive information.

---

# cache-control: no-cache

When `cache-control: no-cache` is provided as a header to an HTTP response the
browser and intermediate proxy-caches:

* must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful
  revalidation with the origin server

Useful to force the browser and intermediate caches to check for updated
content.

---

# cache-control: private

When `cache-control: private` is provided as a header to an HTTP response the
browser is free to cache the response (for the current user) but, intermediate
proxy-caches should discard the data.

This is the opposite of `cache-control: public`.

Rails built-in caching safely assumes `cache-control: private`.

---

# cache-control: max-age=120


When `cache-control: max-age=120` is provided as a header to an HTTP response
the browser and intermediate proxy-caches should consider the information to be
fresh until the specified number of seconds has passed.

This is the modern version of the `expires` and `date` headers.

---

# etag: "5bf444d26f9f1c74"

When an etag (entity tag) header is provided as a header to an HTTP response
the browser will keep an association between the request, the etag, and the
response.

When requesting the same resource in the future, the browser may add an
`if-none-match` header along with the etag in the HTTP request.

---

# last-modified: Wed, 14 Oct 2015 23:47:36 GMT

When a `last-modified` header is provided in an HTTP response the browser may
save the information to use in future requests for the same resource.

When requesting the same resource in the future, the browser may add an
`if-modified-since` header along with the datetime in the HTTP request.

---

# if-none-match: "5bf444d26f9f1c74"

When accompanying an HTTP request, the `if-none-match` HTTP header indicates
that the client has a cached copy with the associated tag.  Multiple etags can
be provided.

If the server's current version of the resource maps to one of the provided
etags, the server will return 304 (not modified) with the etag of the current
resource included.

Otherwise the server will return the full response body along with the
appropriate etag for the updated resource.

---

# if-modified-since: Wed, 14 Oct 2015 23:47:36 GMT

When accompanying an HTTP request, the `if-modified-since` HTTP header
indicates that the client already has a copy that was fresh as of the specified
datetime.

If the server's copy is newer than the specified datetime, it will be served to
the client along with a new `last-modified` HTTP response header.

If the server's copy has not changed since the specified date, the server will
return 304 (not modified).

# HTTP Caching Summary

![Defining optimal Cache-Control policy](http-cache-decision-tree.png)

[Source](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching)

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #1

Assume we want to serve JavaScript that won't change over the next day, but it
contains user-specific code.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

--

## Caching Reusable, Private Resources

```http
Cache-control: private, max-age=86400
```

Intermediate proxy-caches should not save a copy, and the browser can consider
the resource fresh for up to a day since it was retrieved.

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #2

Assume we are serving an image that may change in the future, and we never want
a stale version shown. The image is not specific to the requester.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

--

## Caching Reusable, Public Resources

```http
Cache-control: public, no-cache
ETag: 4d7a6ca05b5df656
```

Browser will store a copy to be used if a 304 (not modified) response is
sent. In subsequent HTTP requests for the resource the browser will include:

```http
if-none-match: 4d7a6ca05b5df656
```

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #3

Assume we are serving an image containing the user's social security and credit
card numbers.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

--

## No Caching!

```http
Cache-control: private, no-store
```

The browser may keep a copy in memory for browser navigation, but __must__
not save a copy to a non-volatile location.

---

# Implementing Caching In Rails

Let's start with implementation client-side HTTP caching on the New Submission
page in the demo app:

.center[![Demo App New Submission View](demo_new_submission.png)]

---

# Initial Request: New Submission Page

Initial page load fetches every resource (indicated via 200 response).

![Initial Demo App New Submission Resources](demo_new_submission_resources.png)


---

# Subsequent Request: New Submission

Refreshing the page doesn't require sending the asset bodies (304 responses),
but the server sends the complete /submissions/new response body (200
response).

![Subsequent Demo App New Submissions Resources](demo_new_submission_resources_subsequent.png)

---

# Determining Staleness

> When can this page be out-of-date?

![Demo App New Submission View](demo_new_submission.png)

---

# SubmissionsController.new

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def new
    @submission = Submission.new
  end

end
```

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def new
*   @submission = Submission.new if stale?(Community.all)
  end

end
```

---

# ActionController::ConditionalGet.stale?

[http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/ConditionalGet/stale%3F](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/ConditionalGet/stale%3F)

> What is `if stale?(Community.all)` actually doing?

* Informs Rails to base the `etag` and/or `last_modified` response header on
  all communities.
* Compares the `last_modified` or `etag` value against `if-modified-since`
  and/or `if-none-match` request headers.
* `stale?` returns true when `Communities.all` is newer and/or differs
* `stale?` implicitly affects the response such that a 304 HTTP status and no
  body is returned when `stale?` returns false

---

# Cached: New Submission Page

After making the above change, a second request to `/submissions/new` results
in a 304 (not modified) response.

If the list of communities change subsequent
responses will return a 200 along with the body of the response.

---

# SubmissionsController.show

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_submission, only: [:show, ...]

  def show
  end

  private

  def set_submission
    @submission = Submission.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

---

# SubmissionsController.show

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_submission, only: [:show, ...]

  def show
*   fresh_when([@submission, @submission.community,
*               @submission.comments])
  end

  private

  def set_submission
    @submission = Submission.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

---

# Cached: SubmissionsController.show

The web console indicates our caching was successful.

Adding a new comment, modifying the community or submission causes a 200
response.

---

# Submissions Index

> What on the submissions index can make the page stale?

![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)

---

# SubmissionsController.index

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @submissions = Submission.all
  end

end
```

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def index
*   if stale?([Submission.all, Community.all, Comments.all])
      @submissions = Submission.all
*   end
  end

end
```

# Caching HTTP Responses: Motivation

A single web server process repeatedly responds to HTTP requests from a variety
of clients.

Responding to each request requires computation and I/O to be
performed, both of which can be expensive.

In practice, there is a significant amount of similarity between HTTP
responses.

In the client-side caching lecture we looked at optimizing scenarios where
requests for the same resource would result in an identical response.

In this lecture we will look at optimizing scenarios where repeated responses
are not identical, but similar.

---

# Caching HTTP Responses

> With respect to HTTP responses for a single web service, which parts of a
> response are similar to responses for other resources?

--

* View fragments
* Rarely modified ORM objects
* Expensive to compute data

---

# View Fragments

View fragments are items that are similar across pages such as the header,
footer, sidebar, or even an item listing that may appear in multiple locations
(product listings, search results, product suggestions).

Sidebar Fragment (shown on all cs291.com pages)

```html
<div class="col-md-3 hidden-xs">
  <div class="sidebar well">
    Scalable Internet Services, CS291A, Fall 2016
  </div>

  <div class="sidebar well">
    <h1 id="course-information">Course Information</h1>
    <h2 id="instructor">Instructor</h2>
    <p><a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~bboe">Dr. Bryce Boe</a>

    <h2 id="lecture">Lecture</h2>
    <p>Tuesday and Thursday<br />
       1:00pm – 2:50pm</p>

    ...

  </div>
</div>
```

---

# Rarely Modified ORM Objects

* User permissions
* Configuration options
* Product details (on a shopping site)
* In general, any database-backed data that seldom changes

---

# Expensive to Compute Data

Expensive to compute data is exactly what the name suggests. Expensive could
mean:

* it takes a significant amount of time to compute
* it is best suited for a background worker due to hardware constraints on the
  application servers.

## Examples

* Total account balance on Mint
* Monthly account summary on Google
* The complete diff between two commits on GitHub
* The list of suggested contacts on LinkedIn

---

# Semi-Expensive Operations

View fragments are produced by extensive string manipulation. In ruby, many
string manipulations with portions loaded from disk can result in a significant
amount of time.

Every query to the database utilizes the database's resources. Optimizing for
similar queries can minimize the chance of a database bottleneck.

--

> Assuming we want to keep previously computed results around between requests,
> how can we do it?

--

> Where can we store the cached results?

---

# Storing Cached Results

Option 1: In memory on the application server

--

Option 2: On the file system

--

Option 3: In memory on another machine

--

Now, let's look into each of these options. But first a look at latency.

---

# Latency Numbers (ns and μs)

---

# Latency Numbers (μs and ms)

![Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know](latency_2_2015.png)

Source: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html

---

# Latency Numbers for Caching

* Storing in memory and reading later is fast
    * Random reads from memory is < 0.1μs
    * Reading 1MB is 9μs

* Storing on disk is slow without SSD (solid state drive):
    * Disk seek is 4000μs
    * Subsequent sequential read of 1MB is 2000μs

* Storing on disk with SSD is much more reasonable
    * Random read is 16μs
    * Sequential read of 1MB is 156μs

* Storing on another machine is reasonable
    * Round trip within data center is 500μs

---

# Latency Numbers Summary

## Summary

* In memory: tens of μs
* On SSD: hundreds of μs
* On magnetic disk: thousands of μs
* On remote machine: __add__ hundreds of μs

## Conclusions

* Prefer SSD over magnetic storage for speed
* Memory > SSD > Remote

> Are these conclusions always true?

---

# Caching Locations

> What effect on the cache hit rate does each of these designs have?

* In memory: cache per process

--

* On SSD: cache per machine

--

* On remote machine: cache per application server pool (cluster)

---

# Caching Location Trade-offs

* In memory
    * highest performance
    * lowest hit rate

* On SSD
    * lower performance
    * higher hit rate

* On remove machine
    * lowest performance
    * highest hit rate

There is no silver bullet.

---

# Caching Trade-offs

> How will each of the following affect system performance:

* Number of processes per machine

--

* Concurrency model of application server

--

* Number of machines per cluster

---

# Memcached

__memcached__ is a commonly used remote cache server. It...

* keeps a cache in memory

* provides a simple TCP protocol to return responses to look up requests

* is a distributed key-value store
    * keys can be up to 250 bytes
    * values can be up to 1MB
    * scales horizontally

* uses a simple LRU (least recently used) to make space for new items when full

* performs all operations in constant time

---

# Server-side Caching in Rails

Rails provides excellent support for server-side caching.

The three primary interfaces to caching in rails are:

* HTTP caching
* Fragment caching
* Low level caching

We already covered HTTP caching. Today we'll discuss the latter two.

---

# Enabling Caching in Rails

By default, caching is disabled in development and test modes, and enabled only
in production mode.

If you want to enable caching in development mode you must make the following
change to your Rails environment:

```ruby
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
```

Rails can be configured to store cached data in a few different places:

* In memory
* On a _local_ file system
* In a remote in-memory store

http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html

---

# Configuring Rails Cache Stores

* ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore

* ActiveSupport::Cache::FileStore

* ActiveSupport::Cache::MemcacheStore

---

# ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore

* Cached data is stored in memory, in the same address space as the ruby
  process.

* Defaults to 32MB, configurable

---

# ActiveSupport::Cache::FileStore

* Cached data is stored on the _local_ file system.

* Can configure the location of the storage in the Rails environment:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :file_store, '/path/to/cache/'
```

---

# ActiveSupport::Cache::MemcacheStore

* Cached data is stored in memory on another machine (could also be local).

* Can configure the location of the server in the Rails environment:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, 'cache-1.example.com'
```

---

# Fragment Caching in Rails

Fragment caching caches a portion of a rendered view for reuse on future
requests.

Let's look at fragment caching in the context of the demo app.

---

# Fragment Caching Submission Partials

.left-column30[
We can cache each submission listing.

With that done, then regardless of any other changes on the page, we can
re-render the submission view for all submissions that haven't been updated.
]
.right-column70[
![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)
]

---

# Submission Listing (without cache)

```erb
<% @submissions.each do |submission| %>



  <tr>
    <td><%= link_to(submission.title, submission.url) %></td>
    <td><%= submission.url %></td>
    <td><%= submission.community.name %></td>
    <td>
      <%= link_to("#{submission.comments.size} comments",
                  submission, class: 'btn btn-primary btn-xs') %>
    </td>
  </tr>



<% end %>
```

---

# Submission Listing (with cache)

```erb
<% @submissions.each do |submission| %>

* <% cache(cache_key_for_submission(submission)) do %>

  <tr>
    <td><%= link_to(submission.title, submission.url) %></td>
    <td><%= submission.url %></td>
    <td><%= submission.community.name %></td>
    <td>
      <%= link_to("#{submission.comments.size} comments",
                  submission, class: 'btn btn-primary btn-xs') %>
    </td>
  </tr>

* <% end %>

<% end %>
```

---

# Choosing a Cache Key

> How should we choose a cache key for a submission?

--

```ruby
module SubmissionHelper
  def cache_key_for_submission(submission)
    "submission/#{submission.id}"
  end
end
```

> What are the weaknesses with the above approach?

--

* Invalidation will need to be explicit as the submission ID will rarely, if
  never, be updated for an object.

* Explicitly invalidating cache items can easily make a mess of the code.

---

# Choosing a Better Cache Key

```ruby
module SubmissionHelper
  def cache_key_for_submission(sub)
    "submission/#{sub.id}/#{sub.updated_at}/#{sub.comments.count}"
  end
end
```

With the above, a submission's fragment cache is invalidated anytime the
submission is updated (`updated_at` is always updated), or when the number of
comments associated with the submission changes.

_Note_: An Active Record model can be used directly as the key. It calls an
over-writable method `cache_key` on the model. By default that method returns a
key that "includes the model name, the id and finally the updated_at
timestamp".

[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#fragment-caching](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#fragment-caching)

---

# More Fragment Caching

.left-column30[
Now we are caching a fragment for each submission.

> What else can we cache?
]
.right-column70[
![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)
]

--

We can cache the entire submission listing!

---

# Community Listing (without cache)

```erb


<h3>Submissions</h3>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Url</th>
      <th>Community</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @submissions.each do |submission| %>
      <% cache(...) do %> ... <% end %>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

...
```

---

# Community Listing (with cache)

```erb
*<% cache(cache_key_for_submission_table) do %>

<h3>Submissions</h3>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Url</th>
      <th>Community</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @submissions.each do |submission| %>
      <% cache(...) do %> ... <% end %>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

...

*<% end %>
```

---

# cache_key_for_submission_table

```ruby
module SubmissionHelper
  def cache_key_for_submission(sub)
    "submission/#{sub.id}/#{sub.updated_at}/#{sub.comments.count}"
  end

* def cache_key_for_submission_table
*   ("submission_table/#{Submission.maximum(:updated_at)}/"
*    + Comment.maximum(:updated_at).to_s)
* end
end
```

This technique of nesting cache fragments is known as __Russian Doll Caching__.

---

# Low-level Rails Caching

You can use the same built-in mechanisms to manually cache anything:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  def competing_price
    Rails.cache.fetch("#{cache_key}/competing_price",
                      expires_in: 12.hours) do
      Competitor::API.find_price(id)
    end
  end
end
```

---

# Performance Comparison

Let's compare the performance of the demo app with and without caching.

The subsequent graphs were generated using Tsung against a deployment of the
`master` branch (without caching) and against a deployment of the
`server_side_caching` branch (with server-side caching) using the default rails
caching mechanism (memory).

The `master` branch intentionally includes no optimizations.

---

# Caching Test: Simulated Users

We will use an m3-medium instance with the usual workload deployed using
passenger as an NGINX module.

Using Tsung (erlang-based test framework) we will simulate multiple users
visiting the Demo App web service. Each user will:

```
Visit the homepage (/)
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Request community creation form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Submit new community form
Request new link submission form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Submit new link submission form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Delete the link
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Delete the community
```

---

# Caching Test: Phases

This time we have six phases of testing each lasting 60 seconds:

```
   (0-59s) Every second a new simulated user arrives
 (60-119s) Every second 1.5 new simulated users arrive
(120-179s) Every second 2 new simulated users arrive
(180-239s) Every second 4 new simulated users arrive
(240-299s) Every second 6 new simulated users arrive
(300-359s) Every second 10 new simulated users arrive
```

# Performance Comparision

Without caching the server struggled to handle a single new arrival each
second.

With server-side caching the server can easily handle up to two
new arrivals a second.

---

# Deploying to AWS

Now that you all have a start to your rails application on Github, it is time
to learn how to deploy to AWS (Amazon Web Service).

Amazon provides a tool called Elastic Beanstalk that we will use to create
various deployments.

https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/

Note: I have verified that my demo app deploys. I need to make a few
cost-saving tweaks. Credentials should be usable again tomorrow.

# Working with AWS Guideliens

The AWS resources we will use are being donated by AppFolio. Please:

* __NEVER__ copy your AWS credentials into your code nor make them publicly
  available.

* Only deploy when you are ready to test something or demo.

* Terminate your deployment immediately when testing or the demo is done
  (billing is on 1-hour intervals from launch time).

--

* For demoing and deployment testing please only use a single `t2.micro`
  instance for the application server, and a `db.t2.micro` instance for the
  database, without a load balancer:

    ```
    eb create -db.i db.t2.micro -i t2.micro --single ...
    ```

# Working with AWS Guidelines

* For vertical scaling tests, always start with the smallest instance type and
  work your way up within the same deployment in order to minimize the time
  that larger instances are deployed for.
  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.ec2.html

--

* For horizontal scaling tests, try to consistently use the smallest instance
  type that works for your application.
  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.as.html

--

* Reset your database, and flush all caches between tests for consistency.

--

* Do not use any of the `micro` instances (app server or database) when
  performing scalability tests they have a CPU quota system that will affect
  results.

--

## When in doubt, please ask.

# AWS Instances and Data

Because instances should only be up for a limited amount of time it's important
to:

* Fetch any important data on the instances as soon as available (e.g., test
  results)

* Quickly load large amounts of testing data (test this process on smaller
  instances)

# Signing into AWS

Yesterday I sent a Piazza message to each team containing your team's private
ssh key (teamname.pem).

Use that to ssh into ec2.cs291.com

```bash
ssh -i teamname.pem teamname@ec2.cs291.com
```

Your AWS web console username and password be found in `~/teamname.txt`.

To login visit:
https://bboe-ucsb.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

## Oregon Region

Ensure that the __Oregon__ (us-west-2) region is selected in the upper right.

# By Next Wednesday

Demonstrate that you can successfully deploy your application to AWS by demoing
on AWS.

__Note__: All teams will be expected to demo on AWS for all following labs.

Launching a new deployment will take >10 minutes so kick it off prior to lab.
