# Scaling Goal

.center[![Load Balanced Topology](load_balanced_topology.png)]

After today you will understand what load balancing is, and why the depicted
architecture provides smooth cost-effective scaling.

---

# The Problem

You've built something the world (or significant subset) is excited about.

> What do you do when your popularity doubles (again, and again)?

---

# The Solutions

## Vertical Scaling

Buying "bigger" hardware and scaling _up_

* __PRO__: Easy

* __CON__: Limited

* __CON__: Non-linear increase in cost when scaling

--

## Horizontal Scaling

Buying more servers and scaling _out_

* __PRO__: Easy to add more servers (limited by data center space)

* __PRO__: Linear (maybe even sublinear) increase in cost when scaling

* __CON__: More moving parts makes things more complicated

---

# Vertical Scaling

---

# Vertical Scaling

When needed, increase the resources of your current server, eventually buy (or
rent) a bigger server with:

* More memory

* More and/or faster CPUs and/or cores

* Higher bandwidth

---

# EC2 and Vertical Scaling

With Amazon EC2 you rent virtual instances. There are clear vertical scaling
paths. Each type of instance (below) has a few options ranging from lower
resources/performance to higher resources/performance:

* __T__ and __M__ prefixed instances: balanced mix of memory and CPU

* __C__ prefixed instances: CPU optimized

* __R__ prefixed instances: Memory optimized

* __G__ prefixed instances: GPU optimized

* __I__ prefixed instances: I/O optimized

* __D__ prefixed instances: Storage capacity optimized

# Scaling Test: Simulated Users

We will use the same test setup explained in the last lecture.

Using Tsung (erlang-based test framework) we will simulate multiple users
visiting the Demo App web service. Each user will:

```
Visit the homepage (/)
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Request community creation form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Submit new community form
Request new link submission form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Submit new link submission form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Delete the link
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Delete the community
```

---

# Scaling Test: Phases

This time we have twelve phases of testing each lasting 60 seconds:

```
 1.    (0-59s) Every second a new simulated user arrives
 2.  (60-119s) Every second 1.5 new simulated users arrive
 3. (120-179s) Every second 2 new simulated users arrive
 4. (180-239s) Every second 4 new simulated users arrive
 5. (240-299s) Every second 6 new simulated users arrive
 6. (300-359s) Every second 10 new simulated users arrive
 7. (360-419s) Every second 16 new simulated users arrive
 8. (420-479s) Every second 20 new simulated users arrive
 9. (480-539s) Every second 25 new simulated users arrive
10. (540-599s) Every second 35 new simulated users arrive
11. (600-659s) Every second 45 new simulated users arrive
12. (660-719s) Every second 55 new simulated users arrive
```

# Horizontal Scaling

# Load Balancing

Vertical scaling requires fewer moving parts but has limited scaling
capability. Eventually horizontal scaling becomes necessary to handle increased
load.

When horizontally scaling HTTP, this technique is referred to as __load
balancing__.

## Basic Idea

* Have many servers that can serve clients

* Make these servers _appear_ as a single endpoint to the outside world

The users' experiences are the same regardless of which server ultimately
handles the request.

---

# Think About It

> How can we enable many servers to serve clients?

Consider the following sequence of actions:

1. `GET /products`
2. `POST /products`
3. `GET /products`

> If these requests are handled by three different servers, will the third
> request show the new product?

---

# Stateless Servers

.center[![Load Balanced Topology](load_balanced_topology.png)]

In order for load balancing to work, the servers must be stateless.

Statelessness can be accomplished by keeping the persistence layer separate
from the application layer.

---

# Load Balancing (1): HTTP Redirects

.left-column30[
Discussed in section 6.1 of the reading.

Implemented using multiple web servers with different domain names.

A request for `www.domain.com` will use HTTP 301 or 302 to redirect the request
to a pool of possible hosts.
]
.right-column70.center[
![Load balancing via redirect](load_balancing_redirect.png)
]

---

# HTTP Redirect Example

```http
% nc www.domain.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: www.domain.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 15 Oct 2014 21:08:22 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu)
Location: http://www2.domain.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
...
```

---

# HTTP Redirects Trade-offs

## Strengths

* Simple

* Location independent

## Weaknesses

* Not transparent to user

* High load on www

* May reduce local-network cache applicability

* Users can bypass load balancer

---

# Load Balancing (2): Round Robin DNS

.left-column30[
Discussed in section 4.1 of the reading.

When a user's browser queries DNS for `www.example.com`, a list of IPs is
returned. The DNS server rotates the list order for each query (or alters
priorities).

The user's browser chooses which IP to connect to (generally picks the first,
or highest priority).
]
.right-column70.center[
![Load balancing via round-robin DNS](load_balancing_round_robin.png)
]

---

# Round Robin DNS Example

```
% host cs291.com
cs291.com has address 192.30.252.153
cs291.com has address 192.30.252.154
```

```
% host cs291.com
cs291.com has address 192.30.252.154
cs291.com has address 192.30.252.153
```

---

# Round Robin DNS Trade-offs

## Strengths

* Simple

* Cheap

## Weaknesses

* Less control over balancing

* Modifying the list is inhibited by caching in the browser and proxies

---

# Load Balancing (3): TCP Load Balancing

.left-column30[
Discussed in section 5 of the reading.

## General Idea

Rewrite TCP packets to send them to the selected server. This includes
addresses, sequence numbers, and checksums.
]
.right-column70.center[
![Load balancing via TCP](load_balancing_tcp.png)
]

## Commercial Products (use hardware ASICs to do this fast)

* Cisco Content Services Switch
* Citrix Netscaler
* F5 Big IP

# TCP Load Balancing Trade-offs

## Strengths

* More control over which requests go to which servers

* Works fine with HTTPs

## Weaknesses

* Limits where the servers can be located (same network)

* Complicated

---

# Load Balancing (4): HTTP Proxy

.left-column30[
Also known as "Layer 7 load balancing"

Terminate HTTP requests: act like a web server

Issue _back-end_ HTTP request to the desired application server.

Hardware products:

* Citrix Netscaler
* F5 Big-IP

Many HTTP servers have modules to do this as well (Apache, NGINX)
]
.right-column70.center[

---

# HTTP Proxy Trade-offs

This is the most popular technique in use (#3 is also used).

## Strengths

* Cleaner implementation than packet rewriting

## Weaknesses

* Load balancer needs to do more work

* HTTPs is more complicated

---

# Load Balancing Considerations

Assume you are to design a load balancing HTTP proxy. You have insight into
every incoming request and response.

> How would you determine which server to forward a request to?

--

## Options

* Random

* Round robin

* Least number of connections

* Fastest response time

* Bandwidth per server

* URI-based mapping (e.g., `/images` to server1, `/admin` to server2)

Amazon's ELB (elastic load balancer) uses round robin with cookie-based
stickiness (send the same client to the same server).

---

# Load Balancing Challenges

When working with and/or designing a load balancing proxy there are some
challenges to consider:

* Detecting and reacting to server failures

* Session affinity and persistence

* Connection pooling

Definitions:

* __Affinity__: Map a client to a server without application-level information
(e.g., IP address, request time)

* __Persistence__: Use application-level
information to map a client to a server (e.g., cookies)

[Reference](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/load-balancing-affinity-persistence-sticky-sessions-what-you-need-to-know/)

---

# Detecting Server Failures

> How do we know when a member of our application pool has died?

Observe traffic. Are requests being processed? Are they just taking a long
time?

Probe the server through various means:

* __ICMP ping__: tests the network and server kernel

* __TCP connection__: the process is running and accepting connections

* __HTTP HEAD__: the application is serving pages

* __SNMP__: Provides insight into server load (and more if configured)

---

# Session Affinity and Persistence

> Can we redirect users back to the same web server they used before?

Doing so can provide some caching improvements.

A few options:

* Affinity based on client IP address (concerns: client IPs change, and IPs are
shared)

* HTTP Cookie (works but requires proxy configuration)

* Session ID in URL (not a great solution)

---

# Connection Pooling

We're used to the idea that one client reuses a TCP connection for many HTTP
requests.

We can reuse this mechanism for distinct clients.

Saves on repeated TCP setup between the load balancer and application servers.

Reduces idle waiting on server for reads and writes.

---

# Software Load Balancers

* Apache

* NGINX

* HAProxy

* Varnish

* Pound

* Squid

---

# Amazon Elastic Load Balancer

Amazon provides load balancing as a service:

* $0.025 per load balancer hour

* $0.008 per GB of data processed

* Works with EC2 autoscaling groups

* Supports TLS termination

* Supports load balancing between Availability Zones within a Region

__Does not__: support load balancing between regions (e.g., between us-west-1
and us-west-2). Consider using Route 53 DNS for region failover.

---

# Horizontal Scaling Test

In the vertical scaling tests, the database application ran on the same machine
as the web server application.

For these tests we are going to use a single machine for the database. This
will make it easy to scale up the number of application servers.

# Horizontal Scaling For The Win!

Vertical scaling handled only 20 new users per second at a cost of about $600
per month. There was no clear scaling path after that point.

Horizontal scaling handled 45 new users per second at a cost of about $600 per
month. The scaling path is clear. Add more servers for a linear increase in
cost.
