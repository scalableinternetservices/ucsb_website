# Client-side Caching Motivation

We want our important application data persisted safely in our data center.

This data will be regularly read and updated by geographically distributed
clients.

Our access to the data needs to be fast.

# Response Time and Human Perception

| Delay         | User Reaction                |
| -------------:|:----------------------------:|
|   0 -  100 ms | Instant                      |
| 100 -  300 ms | Small perceptible delay      |
| 300 - 1000 ms | Machine is working           |
|      1000+ ms | Likely mental context switch |
|    10,000+ ms | Task is abandoned            |

# Multiple HTTP Requests per Page

![Total Requests Per Page](httparchive_requests_per_page.png)

Source: http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#reqTotal

---

# Caching

The fastest request is one that never happens.

__Cache__: a component that transparently stores data so that future requests
for the same data can be served faster

> Where can we introduce caching?

--

* Inside the browser

* In "front" of the server (CDNs, ISP cache, etc.)

* Inside the application server

* Inside the database (query cache)

---

# Client-side Caching

> How does the browser cache data?

--

> How does the browser know when it can or cannot use cached data?

--

The building blocks of caching are all provided via HTTP headers:

* cache-control
    * no-store
    * no-cache
    * max-age
    * public | private

* etag

* last-modified

* if-none-match

* if-modified-since

---

# cache-control: no-store

When `cache-control: no-store` is provided as a header to an HTTP response the
browser and intermediate proxy-caches:

* must not save the information in any non-volatile storage

* must make a best effort attempt to remove the information from volatile
  storage as promptly as possible

__Note__: The browser may retain a copy in memory (volatile storage) for use
with the browser's back/forward buttons.

Generally used for sensitive information.

---

# cache-control: no-cache

When `cache-control: no-cache` is provided as a header to an HTTP response the
browser and intermediate proxy-caches:

* must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful
  revalidation with the origin server

Useful to force the browser and intermediate caches to check for updated
content.

---

# cache-control: private

When `cache-control: private` is provided as a header to an HTTP response the
browser is free to cache the response (for the current user) but, intermediate
proxy-caches should discard the data.

This is the opposite of `cache-control: public`.

Rails built-in caching securely defaults to `cache-control: private`.

---

# cache-control: max-age=120


When `cache-control: max-age=120` is provided as a header to an HTTP response
the browser and intermediate proxy-caches should consider the information to be
fresh until the specified number of seconds (`120` in this case) has passed.

This is the modern version of the `expires` and `date` headers.

---

# etag: "5bf444d26f9f1c74"

When an etag (entity tag) header is provided as a header to an HTTP response
the browser will keep an association between the request, the etag, and the
response.

When requesting the same resource in the future, the browser may add an
`if-none-match` header along with the etag in the HTTP request.

---

# last-modified: Wed, 14 Oct 2015 23:47:36 GMT

When a `last-modified` header is provided in an HTTP response the browser may
save the information to use in future requests for the same resource.

When requesting the same resource in the future, the browser may add an
`if-modified-since` header along with the datetime in the HTTP request.

---

# First GET Example

```
$ curl -I https://cs291.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Last-Modified: Mon, 21 Oct 2019 21:41:43 GMT
ETag: "5dae2617-48a8"
Cache-Control: max-age=600
```

---

# if-none-match: "5bf444d26f9f1c74"

When accompanying an HTTP request, the `if-none-match` HTTP header indicates
that the client has a cached copy with the associated tag.  Multiple etags can
be provided.

If the server's current version of the resource maps to one of the provided
etags, the server will return 304 (not modified) with the etag of the current
resource included.

Otherwise the server will return the full response body along with the
appropriate etag for the updated resource.


```sh
$ curl -I https://cs291.com --header 'if-none-match: "5dae2617-48a8"'

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

---

# if-modified-since: Wed, 14 Oct 2015 23:47:36 GMT

When accompanying an HTTP request, the `if-modified-since` HTTP header
indicates that the client already has a copy that was fresh as of the specified
datetime.

If the server's copy is newer than the specified datetime, it will be served to
the client along with a new `last-modified` HTTP response header.

If the server's copy has not changed since the specified date, the server will
return 304 (not modified).


```sh
$ curl -I https://cs291.com --header 'if-modified-since: Mon, 21 Oct 2019 21:41:43 GMT'

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

# HTTP Caching Summary

![Defining optimal Cache-Control policy](http-cache-decision-tree.png)

[Source](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching)

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #1

Assume we want to serve JavaScript that won't change over the next day, but it
contains user-specific code.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

--

## Caching Reusable, Private Resources

```http
Cache-control: private, max-age=86400
```

Intermediate proxy-caches should not save a copy, and the browser can consider
the resource fresh for up to a day since it was retrieved.

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #2

Assume we are serving an image that may change in the future, and we never want
a stale version shown. The image is not specific to the requester.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

--

## Caching Reusable, Public Resources

```http
Cache-control: public, no-cache
ETag: 4d7a6ca05b5df656
```

Browser will store a copy to be used if a 304 (not modified) response is
sent. In subsequent HTTP requests for the resource the browser will include:

```http
if-none-match: 4d7a6ca05b5df656
```

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #3

Assume we are serving an image containing the user's social security and credit
card numbers.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

--

## No Caching!

```http
Cache-control: no-store
```

The browser may keep a copy in memory for browser navigation, but __must__
not save a copy to a non-volatile location.

---

# Implementing Caching In Rails

Let's start with implementation client-side HTTP caching on the New Submission
page in the demo app:

.center[![Demo App New Submission View](demo_new_submission.png)]

---

# Initial Request: New Submission Page

Initial page load fetches every resource (indicated via 200 response).

.center[![Initial Demo App New Submission Resources](demo_new_submission_resources.png)]


---

# Subsequent Request: New Submission

Refreshing the page doesn't require sending the asset bodies (304 responses),
but the server sends the complete /submissions/new response body (200
response).

.center[![Subsequent Demo App New Submissions Resources](demo_new_submission_resources_subsequent.png)]

---

# Determining Staleness

> When can this page be out-of-date?

.center[![Demo App New Submission View](demo_new_submission.png)]

---

# SubmissionsController.new

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def new
    @submission = Submission.new
  end

end
```

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def new
*   @submission = Submission.new if stale?(Community.all)
  end

end
```

---

# ActionController::ConditionalGet.stale?

[http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/ConditionalGet/stale%3F](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/ConditionalGet/stale%3F)

> What is `if stale?(Community.all)` actually doing?

* Informs Rails to base the `etag` and/or `last_modified` response header on
  all communities.

* Compares the `last_modified` or `etag` value against `if-modified-since`
  and/or `if-none-match` request headers.

* `stale?` returns true when `Communities.all` is newer and/or differs

* `stale?` implicitly affects the response such that a 304 HTTP status and no
  body is returned when `stale?` returns false

---

# Cached: New Submission Page

After making the above change, a second request to `/submissions/new` results
in a 304 (not modified) response.

If the list of communities change subsequent
responses will return a 200 along with the body of the response.

# Submission View

.left-column30[
> What on the submission view can make the page stale?
]
.right-column70.center[

---

# SubmissionsController.show

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_submission, only: [:show, ...]

  def show
  end

  private

  def set_submission
    @submission = Submission.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

---

# SubmissionsController.show

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_submission, only: [:show, ...]

  def show
*   fresh_when([@submission, @submission.community,
*               @submission.comments])
  end

  private

  def set_submission
    @submission = Submission.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

---

# Cached: SubmissionsController.show

The web console indicates our caching was successful.

Adding a new comment, modifying the community or submission causes a 200
response.

.center[![Cached Demo App Submission Show](demo_submission_view_cached.png)]

---

# Submissions Index

> What on the submissions index can make the page stale?

.center[![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)]

---

# SubmissionsController.index

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @submissions = Submission.all
  end

end
```

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def index
*   if stale?([Submission.all, Community.all, Comments.all])
      @submissions = Submission.all
*   end
  end

end
```
