# High Availability and Client-side Caching

__CS290B__

Dr. Bryce Boe

October 15, 2015

---

# Today's Agenda

* TODO
* Scaling Review
* Corrections
* High Availability
* Client-side Caching

---

# TODO

## Should be done

* Agile Web Development with Rails up through chapter 17
* As much progress on Sprint 1 commitment as possible

---

# Scaling Review

## Vertical Scaling

Buying "bigger" hardware and scaling _up_

* __PRO__: Easy
* __CON__: Limited
* __CON__: Non-linear increase in cost when scaling

## Horizontal Scaling

Buying move servers and scaling _out_

* __PRO__: Easy to add more servers (limited by data center space)
* __PRO__: Linear increase in cost when scaling
* __CON__: More moving parts makes things more complicated

---

# Last Lecture Corrections

HTTP Reverse Proxies are Layer __7__ (not layer __6__)

The TCP session example demonstrates a TCP proxy version of load
balancing. While this approach works, it requires a TCP connection from the
client to the load balancer and another connection form the load balancer to
the server.

Of course the load balancer can maintain a pool of connections to
each application server minimizing the overhead of TCP connection
establishment.

The other version of TCP load balancing simply rewrites packets (both incoming
and outgoing). This process is similar to how NAT (network address translation)
works.

ELB's TCP-level load balancing does it via the TCP proxy method.

---

# High Availability Motivation

Modern web applications power some very important parts of our lives.

* Banking
* Medical
* Telephony

Having anytime access to these services (high availability) is increasingly
important.

---

# Expressing Availability

Companies offering services will often advertise some number of nines
availability:

* Three nines: 99.9% uptime, 525.6 minutes of downtime a year (43.8/mo)
* Four nines: 99.99% uptime, 52.6 minutes of downtime a year (4.38/mo)
    * Desired by many business applications
* Five nines: 99.999% uptime, 5.3 minutes of downtime a year (26.5s/mo)
    * Desired by communication companies

Downtime usually only includes unplanned outages. Scheduled outages, no matter
how frequent, are usually not incorporated in marketing material.

# Question

> What are possible causes of failures?

![Full network topology](full_stack.png)

---

# What if...

> What are possible causes of failures?

* a server process hangs?
* a server process dies?
* an application server fails?
* the load balancer fails?
* the switch fails?
* the router fails?
* the Internet fails?
* the database fails?
* the entire data center fails?

---

# Handling Application Server Failure

![Single application server](application_server.png)

We've already discussed the components of this sort of failure.

* Process-level isolation reduces hanging, or dead processes by having other
  processes to pick up the slack.
* A process in an infinite loop may add unnecessary load to the server, so it's
  important to have monitoring to detect such issues.
* Having a load-balanced configuration permits failing servers (high load or
dead) by having a pool of other servers to direct traffic to.

---

# How do we Handle Load Balancer Failure?

![Single load balancer](single_load_balancer.png)

---

# Redundant Load Balancers

![Redundant load balancers](redundant_load_balancers.png)

Buy two load balancers. One is the primary, and the other is the failover.

Load balancers communicate via a heartbeat to determine the health of each
other.

* _During a failover, what happens to established flows?_
* _During a failover, what happens to the IP address?_

---

# Load Balancer Failover

When the failure determines it needs to become the primary (detected via lack
of heartbeat), it issues a gratuitous ARP for the load balanced IP.

The gratuitous ARP (layer 2) will inform the switch that traffic should be
delivered to the port that leads to the former failover (now primary).

All new packets will transparently be delivered to the new primary load
balancer.

Established flows can be supported depending on how much information sharing
occurs between the load balancers.

---

# How do we Handle Switch Failure?

![Redundant load balancers](redundant_load_balancers.png)


---

# Redundant Switches

Buy two switches! Again with a primary and failover and a heartbeat.

During failover similar issues occur but layer 2 should be stateless so no/less
synchronization needed.

![Redundant switches](redundant_switches.png)

---

# How do we Handle Router Failure?

![Redundant switches](redundant_switches.png)

---

# Redundant Routers

Buy two!

Similar heartbeat and failover system, with slightly different problems.

![Redundant routers](redundant_routers.png)

---

# How do we Handle Internet Failure?

Buy two! Use separate internet service providers (ISPs).

![Redundant routers](redundant_routers.png)

---

# Routing with Two ISPs

> How do we handle routing when we have two ISPs?

## Outgoing Traffic (easy)

We control how we send outbound traffic so we have some options:

* Pick the cheapest or most reliable link
* Pick the _closer_ link

## Incoming Traffic (hard)

We cannot inform clients by which path to reach our IP.

However, we can give hints by using BGP to persuade networks to prefer one path
over another. (Path prepending, Community values)

---

# High Availability

![High Availability Topology](high_availability.png)

We will discuss database failover in another lecture.

---

# Redundancy Everywhere!

So we have redundant systems in place.

# Availability Axiom (Pete Tenereillo)

> The only way to achieve high-availability for browser based clients is to

An A record is an IP address associated with a DNS host.

## Result

* For performance we want to send the browser to one data center.
* For availability we want to send the browser multiple A records.

We end up having to make a choice between performance and availability.

# Multi-site High Availability

# Client-side Caching

# Client-side Caching Motivation

We want our important application data persisted safely in our data center.

This data will be regularly read and updated by geographically distributed
clients.

Our access to the data needs to be fast.

# Multiple HTTP Requests per Page

![Total Requests Per Page](httparchive_requests_per_page.png)

Source: [http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#reqTotal](http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#reqTotal)

---

# Caching

The fastest request is one that never happens.

__Cache__: a component that transparently stores data so that future requests
for the same data can be served faster

> Where can we introduce caching?

* Inside the browser
* In "front" of the server (CDNs, ISP cache, etc.)
* Inside the application server
* Inside the database (query cache)

---

# Client-side Caching

> How does the browser cache data?

> How does the browser know when it can or cannot use cached data?

The building blocks of caching are all provided via HTTP headers:

* cache-control
    * no-store
    * no-cache
    * max-age
    * public | private
* etag
* last-modified
* if-none-match

* if-modified-since

---

# cache-control: no-store

When `cache-control: no-store` is provided as a header to a HTTP response the
browser and intermediate proxy-caches:

* must not save the information in any non-volatile storage
* must make a best effort attempt to remove the information from volatile
  storage as promptly as possible

__Note__: The browser may retain a copy in memory (volatile storage) for use
with the browser's back/forward buttons.

Generally used for sensitive information.

---

# cache-control: no-cache

When `cache-control: no-cache` is provided as a header to a HTTP response the
browser and intermediate proxy-caches:

* must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful
  revalidation with the origin server

Useful to force the browser and intermediate caches to check for updated
content.

---

# cache-control: private

When `cache-control: private` is provided as a header to a HTTP response the
browser is free to cache the response (for the current user) but, intermediate
proxy-caches should discard the data.

This is the opposite of `cache-control: public`.

Rails built-in caching safely assumes `cache-control: private`.

---

# cache-control: max-age=120


When `cache-control: max-age=120` is provided as a header to a HTTP response
the browser and intermediate proxy-caches should consider the information to be
fresh until the specified number of seconds has passed.

This is the modern version of the `expires` and `date` headers.

---

# etag: "5bf444d26f9f1c74"

When an etag (entity tag) header is provided as a header to a HTTP response the
browser will keep an association between the request, the etag, and the
response information.

When requesting the same resource in the future, the browser may add an
`if-none-match` header along with the etag in the HTTP request.

---

# last-modified: Wed, 14 Oct 2015 23:47:36 GMT

-

When a `last-modified` header is provided in an HTTP response the browser may
save the information to use in future requests for the same resource.

When requesting the same resource in the future, the browser may add an
`if-modified-since` header along with the datetime in the HTTP request.

---

# if-none-match: "5bf444d26f9f1c74"

When accompanying a HTTP request, the `if-none-match` HTTP header indicates
that the client has a cached copy with the associated tag.  Multiple etags can
be provided.

If the server's current version of the resource maps to one of the provided
etags, the server will return 304 (not modified) with the etag of the current
resource included.

Otherwise the server will return the full response body along with the
appropriate etag for the updated resource.

---

# if-modified-since: Wed, 14 Oct 2015 23:47:36 GMT

-

When accompanying an HTTP request, the `if-modified-since` HTTP header
indicates that the client already has a copy that was fresh as of the specified
datetime.

If the server's copy is newer than the specified datetime, it will be served to
the client along with a new `last-modified` HTTP response header.

If the server's copy has not changed since the specified date, the server will
return 304 (not modified).

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #1

Assume we want to serve JavaScript that won't change over the next day, but it
contains user-specific code.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

---

# Caching Reusable, Private Resources

    Cache-control: private, max-age=86400

Intermediate proxy-caches should not save a copy, and the browser can consider
the resource fresh for up to a day since it was retrieved.

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #2

Assume we are serving an image that may change in the future, and we never want
a stale version shown. The image is not specific to the requester.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

---

# Caching Reusable, Public Resources

    Cache-control: public, no-cache
    ETag: "4d7a6ca05b5df656"

Browser will store a copy to be used if a 304 (not modified) response is
sent. In subsequent HTTP requests for the resource the browser will include:

    if-none-match: "4d7a6ca05b5df656"

---

# Applying Client-side Caching #3

Assume we are serving an image containing the user's social security and credit
card numbers.

> What headers should the HTTP response include?

---

# No Caching!

    Cache-control: no-store

The browser may keep a copy in memory for browser navigation, but __must__
not save a copy to a non-volatile location.

---

# Implementing Caching In Rails

Let's start with implementation client-side HTTP caching on the New Submission
page in the demo app:

![Demo App New Submission View](demo_new_submission.png)

---

# Initial Request: New Submission Page

Initial page load fetches every resource (indicated via 200 response).

![Initial Demo App New Submission Resources](demo_new_submission_resources.png)


---

# Subsequent Request: New Submission

Refreshing the page doesn't require sending the asset bodies (304 responses),
but the server sends the complete /submissions/new response body (200
response).

![Subsequent Demo App New Submissions Resources](demo_new_submission_resources_subsequent.png)

---

# Determining Staleness

> When can this page be out-of-date?

![Demo App New Submission View](demo_new_submission.png)

---

# SubmissionsController.new

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def new
    @submission = Submission.new
  end

end
```

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def new
    @submission = Submission.new if stale?(Community.all)
  end

end
```

---

# ActionController::ConditionalGet.stale?

[http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/ConditionalGet/stale%3F](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/ConditionalGet/stale%3F)

> What is `if stale?(Community.all)` actually doing?

* Informs Rails to base the `etag` and/or `last_modified` response header on
  all communities.
* Compares the `last_modified` or `etag` value against `if-modified-since`
  and/or `if-none-match` request headers.
* `stale?` returns true when `Communities.all` is newer and/or differs
* `stale?` implicitly affects the response such that a 304 HTTP status and no
  body is returned when `stale?` returns false

---

# Cached: New Submission Page

After making the above change, a second request to `/submissions/new` results
in a 304 (not modified) response.

If the list of communities change subsequent
responses will return a 200 along with the body of the response.

![Cached Demo App New Submissions Resources](demo_new_submission_resources_cached.png)

---

# Submission View

![Submission View](demo_submission_view.png)

> What on the submission view can make the page stale?

---

# SubmissionsController.show

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_submission, only: [:show, ...]

  def show
  end

  private

  def set_submission
    @submission = Submission.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

---

# SubmissionsController.show

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_submission, only: [:show, ...]

  def show
    fresh_when([@submission, @submission.community,
                @submission.comments])
  end

  private

  def set_submission
    @submission = Submission.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

---

# Cached: SubmissionsController.show

The web console indicates our caching was successful.

Adding a new comment, modifying the community or submission causes a 200
response.

![Cached Demo App Submission Show](demo_submission_view_cached.png)

---

# Submissions Index

> What on the submissions index can make the page stale?

![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)

---

# SubmissionsController.index

## Without Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @submissions = Submission.all
  end

end
```

## With Caching

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    if stale?([Submission.all, Community.all, Comments.all])
      @submissions = Submission.all
    end
  end

end
```
