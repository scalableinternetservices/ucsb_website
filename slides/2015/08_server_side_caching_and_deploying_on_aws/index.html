# Today's Agenda

* High Availability Review
* Client-Side Caching Review
* Server-side Caching
* Deploying on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

---

# High Availability Review

![High Availability in Two Sites](dual_site_availability.png)

# Client-side Caching in Rails

* Use `stale?` if you want to conditionally execute a section of code only
  if the client doesn't have a cached version.

* Use `fresh_when` if you only want to use/set the cache headers.

---

# Goals for Today

## After today you should understand...

* why server-side caching exists
* what options you have when using server-side caching
* how to use server-side caching in your projects
* how to deploy on AWS using CloudFormation

---

# Caching HTTP Responses: Motivation

A single web server process repeatedly responds to HTTP requests from a variety
of clients.

Responding to each request requires computation and/or I/O to be
performed, both of which can be expensive.

In practice, there is a significant amount of similarity between HTTP
responses.

In the client-side caching lecture we looked at optimizing scenarios where
requests for the same resource would result in an identical response.

In this lecture we will look at optimizing scenarios where repeated responses
are not identical, but similar.

* View fragments
* Rarely modified ORM objects
* Expensive to compute data

---

# View Fragments

View fragments are items that are similar across pages such as the header,
footer, sidebar, or even an item listing that may appear in multiple locations
(product listings, search results, product suggestions).

Sidebar Fragment (shown on all cs290.com pages)

```html
<div class="col-md-3 hidden-xs">
  <div class="sidebar well">

       3:00pm – 4:50pm</p>

    ...

  </div>
</div>
```

---

# Rarely Modified ORM Objects

* User permissions
* Configuration options
* Product details (on a shopping site)
* In general, any database-backed data that seldom changes

---

# Expensive to Compute Data

Expensive to compute data is exactly what the name suggests. Expensive may mean
it takes a significant amount of time to compute, or maybe it is best suited
for a background worker due to hardware constraints on the application servers.

## Examples

* Total account balance on Mint
* Monthly account summary on Google
* The complete diff between two commits on GitHub
* The list of suggested contacts on LinkedIn

---

# Semi-Expensive Operations

View fragments are produced by extensive string manipulation. In ruby, many
string manipulations with portions loaded from disk can result in a significant
amount of time.

Every query to the database utilizes its resources. Optimizing for similar
queries can minimize the chance of a database bottleneck.

> Assuming we want to keep previously computed results around between requests,
> how can we do it?

> Where can we store the cached results?

---

# Storing Cached Results

Option 1: In memory on the application server

Option 2: On the file system

Option 3: In memory on another machine

Now, let's look into each of these options. But first a look at latency.

---

# Latency Numbers (ns and μs)

---

# Latency Numbers (μs and ms)

![Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know](latency_2_2015.png)

Source: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html

---

# Latency Numbers for Caching

* Storing in memory and reading later is fast
    * Random reads from memory is < 0.1μs
    * Reading 1MB is 9μs
* Storing on disk is slow without SSD (solid state drive):
    * Disk seek is 4000μs
    * Subsequent sequential read of 1MB is 2000μs
* Storing on disk with SSD is much more reasonable
    * Random read is 16μs
    * Sequential read of 1MB is 156μs
* Storing on another machine is reasonable
    * Round trip within data center is 500μs

---

# Latency Numbers Summary

## Summary

* In memory: tens of μs
* On SSD: hundreds of μs
* On magnetic disk: thousands of μs
* On remote machine: add hundreds of μs

## Conclusions

* Always use SSD over magnetic storage
* Memory > SSD > Remote

> Are these conclusions always true?

---

# Caching Locations

> What effect on the cache hit rate does each of these designs have?

* In memory: cache per process
* On SSD: Cache per machine
* On remote machine: Cache per application server pool (cluster)

---

# Caching Location Trade-offs

* In memory
    * highest performance
    * lowest hit rate
* On SSD
    * lower performance
    * higher hit rate
* On remove machine
    * lowest performance
    * highest hit rate

There is no silver bullet.

---

# Caching Trade-offs

> How will each of the following affect system performance:

* Number of processes per machine
* Concurrency model of application server
* Number of machines per cluster

---

# Memcached

__memcached__ is a commonly used remote cache server. It...

* keeps a cache in memory
* provides a simple TCP protocol to return responses to look up requests
* is a distributed key-value store
    * keys can be up to 250 bytes
    * values can be up to 1MB
    * scales horizontally
* uses a simple LRU (least recently used) to make space for new items when full
* performs all operations in constant time

---

# Server-side Caching in Rails

Rails provides excellent support for server-side caching.

The three primary interfaces to caching in rails are:

* HTTP caching
* Fragment caching
* Low level caching

We already covered HTTP caching. Today we'll discuss the latter two.

---

# Enabling Caching in Rails

By default, caching is disabled in development and test modes, and enabled only
in production mode.

If you want to enable caching in development mode you must make the following
change to your Rails environment:

```ruby
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
```

Rails can be configured to store cached data in a few different places:

* In memory
* On a _local_ file system
* In a remote in-memory store

---

# Rails Cache Stores

## ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore

* Cached data is stored in memory, in the same address space as the ruby
  process.
* Defaults to 32MB, configurable

## ActiveSupport::Cache::FileStore

* Cached data is stored on the _local_ file system.
* Can configure the location of the storage in the Rails environment:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :file_store, '/path/to/cache/'
```

## ActiveSupport::Cache::MemcacheStore

* Cached data is stored in memory on another machine (could also be local).
* Can configure the location of the server in the Rails environment:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, 'cache-1.example.com'
```

---

# Rails: Fragment Caching

Fragment caching caches a portion of a rendered view for reuse on future
requests.

Let's look at fragment caching in the context of the demo app.

---

# Fragment Caching Submission Partials

![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)

We can cache each submission listing.

With that done, then regardless of any other changes on the page, we can
re-render the submission view for all submissions that haven't been updated.

---

# Submission Listing (without cache)

```erb
<% @submissions.each do |submission| %>
  <tr>
    <td><%= link_to(submission.title, submission.url) %></td>
    <td><%= submission.url %></td>
    <td><%= submission.community.name %></td>
    <td>
      <%= link_to("#{submission.comments.size} comments",
                  submission, class: 'btn btn-primary btn-xs') %>
    </td>
  </tr>
<% end %>
```

---

# Submission Listing (with cache)

```erb
<% @submissions.each do |submission| %>

  <% cache(cache_key_for_submission(submission)) do %>

  <tr>
    <td><%= link_to(submission.title, submission.url) %></td>
    <td><%= submission.url %></td>
    <td><%= submission.community.name %></td>
    <td>
      <%= link_to("#{submission.comments.size} comments",
                  submission, class: 'btn btn-primary btn-xs') %>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <% end %>

<% end %>
```

---

# Choosing a Cache Key

> How should we choose a cache key?

```ruby
module SubmissionHelper
  def cache_key_for_submission(submission)
    "submission/#{submission.id}"
  end
end
```

> What are the weaknesses with the above approach?

---

# Choosing a Cache Key (answer)

> How should we choose a cache key?

```ruby
module SubmissionHelper
  def cache_key_for_submission(submission)
    "submission/#{submission.id}"
  end
end
```

> What are the weaknesses with the above approach?

* Invalidation will need to be explicit as the submission ID will rarely, if
  never, be updated for an object.
* Explicitly invalidating cache items can easily make a mess of the code.

---

# Choosing a Better Cache Key

```ruby
module SubmissionHelper
  def cache_key_for_submission(sub)
    "submission/#{sub.id}/#{sub.updated_at}/#{sub.comments.count}"
  end
end
```

With the above, a submission's fragment cache is invalidated anytime the
submission is updated (`updated_at` is always updated), or when the number of
comments associated with the submission changes.

_Note_: An Active Record model can be used directly as the key. It calls an
over-writable method `cache_key` on the model. By default that method returns a
key that "includes the model name, the id and finally the updated_at
timestamp".

[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#fragment-caching](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#fragment-caching)

---

# More Fragment Caching

![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)

Now we are caching a fragment for each submission.

> What else can we cache?

--

We can cache the entire submission listing!

---

# Community Listing (without cache)

```erb
<h3>Submissions</h3>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Url</th>
      <th>Community</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @submissions.each do |submission| %>
      <% cache(...) do %> ... <% end %>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

...
```

---

# Community Listing (with cache)

```erb
<% cache(cache_key_for_submission_table) do %>

<h3>Submissions</h3>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>...</tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @submissions.each do |submission| %>
      <% cache(...) do %> ... <% end %>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

...

<% end %>
```

---

# cache_key_for_submission_table

```ruby
module SubmissionHelper
  def cache_key_for_submission(sub)
    "submission/#{sub.id}/#{sub.updated_at}/#{sub.comments.count}"
  end

  def cache_key_for_submission_table
    ("submission_table/#{Submission.maximum(:updated_at)}/"
     + Comment.maximum(:updated_at).to_s)
  end
end
```

This technique of nesting cache fragments is known as __Russian Doll Caching__.

---

# Low-level Rails Caching

You can use the same built-in mechanisms to manually cache anything:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  def competing_price
    Rails.cache.fetch("#{cache_key}/competing_price",
                      expires_in: 12.hours) do
      Competitor::API.find_price(id)
    end
  end
end
```

---

# Performance Comparison

Let's compare the performance of the demo app with and without caching.

The subsequent graphs were generated using Tsung against a deployment of the
`master` branch (without caching) and against a deployment of the
`server_side_caching` branch (with server-side caching) using the default rails
caching mechanism (memory).

The `master` branch intentionally includes no optimizations.

---

# Caching Test: Simulated Users

We will use an m3-medium instance with the usual workload deployed using
passenger as an NGINX module.

Using Tsung (erlang-based test framework) we will simulate multiple users
visiting the Demo App web service. Each user will:

```
Visit the homepage (/)
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Request community creation form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Submit new community form
Request new link submission form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Submit new link submission form
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Delete the link
  Wait randomly between 0 and 2 seconds
Delete the community
```

---

# Caching Test: Phases

This time we have six phases of testing each lasting 60 seconds:

```
   (0-59s) Every second a new simulated user arrives
 (60-119s) Every second 1.5 new simulated users arrive
(120-179s) Every second 2 new simulated users arrive
(180-239s) Every second 4 new simulated users arrive
(240-299s) Every second 6 new simulated users arrive
(300-359s) Every second 10 new simulated users arrive
```

---

# Performance without Caching

The application struggles to handle a single user arriving each second.

![Performance without caching](performance_no_caching.png)

---

# Performance with Caching

With server-side caching implemented, the server can easily handle up to two
new users a second.

![Performance with caching](performance_server_cache.png)

---

# Deploying to AWS

Now that you all have a start to your rails application on Github, it is time
to learn how to deploy to AWS (Amazon Web Service).

Amazon provides a tool called CloudFormation that we will be using to create
various deployments.

The various templates can be found at:
[https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/utils](https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/utils).

---

# AWS Warnings and Rules

The resources we have been granted via the _AWS in Education Grant award_ are
limited for this class. Please:

* Only launch instances when you are ready to test something.
* Shutdown instances immediately when testing is done.
* For deployment testing please only use the single-instance `t2.micro`
  instances
* For vertical scaling tests, always start with the smallest instance type and
  work your way up in order to minimize the larger instance launch time.
* For horizontal scaling tests, try to consistently use the smallest instance
  type.
* Do not use any of the `micro` instances when performing scalability
  tests they have a quota system that can affect results).

__In general__: When it doubt, please ask.

In order to enforce minimal instance usage, all instances will be automatically
terminated after 4 hours. If you want to leave an always on `t2.micro` instance
running please let me know and I can exclude it.

---

# AWS Instances and Data

Because instances can only live for 4 hours it is important to:

* Fetch any important data on the instances as soon as available (e.g., test
  results)
* Quickly load large amounts of testing data (test this process on smaller
  instances)

---

# Signing into AWS

This evening I will send a piazza message to each team containing your team's
credentials to login to the AWS interface.

To login visit:
[https://bboe.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://bboe.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)

![bboe AWS Sign-in](aws_signin.png)

---

# North Virginia Region

Ensure that the __N. Virginia__ (us-east-1) region is selected in the upper
right.

![AWS N. Virginia](aws_region.png)

---

# CloudFormation

Click the _CloudFormation_ service link in the middle column under the
_Management Tools_ section.

![AWS CloudFormation](aws_cloud_formation.png)

---

# CloudFormation (Subsequent Visits)

On subsequent visits __CloudFormation__ will appear in your
_Services/History_. Also note that the link is the fourth one under the __All
AWS Services__ section.

![AWS CloudFormation History](aws_cloud_formation_history.png)

---

# Stack Listing

Observe the various stacks that are launched.

Click the blue __Create Stack__ button to create a new stack.

![AWS CloudFormation View](aws_cloud_formation_view.png)

---

# Find a Template to Launch

Copy the URL for the desired UCSB CloudFormation template from the list at:
[https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/utils/](https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/utils/)

For now, the only available template is the Single Instance UCSB WEBrick
template at:
[https://cs290b.s3.amazonaws.com/SingleWEBrick.json](https://cs290b.s3.amazonaws.com/SingleWEBrick.json)

![Template URLs](template_urls.png)

## October 27 Update

Please use this template now:
[https://cs290b.s3.amazonaws.com/SinglePassenger.json](https://cs290b.s3.amazonaws.com/SinglePassenger.json)

---

# Specifying a CloudFormation Template

Paste the URL of the template into the _Specify an Amazon S3 template URL_
field, and click the blue__Next__ button when ready.

![CloudFormation Template](aws_cloud_formation_template.png)

---

# Specifying CloudFormation Parameters

1. Provide a stack name. Your stack name start exactly with your TeamName (case
   sensitive). Following your stack name you should provide your name and maybe
   the purpose of the stack, e.g. `demo-bboe-4apps`, and `demo-bboe-tsung`.
2. Select the application server EC2 instance type. Please use `t2.micro` for
   deployment testing. You will use larger instances when load testing.
3. Specify the git branch of your application server to deploy.
4. Select your team name.

![CloudFormation parameters](aws_cloud_formation_parameters.png)

---

# Disable Rollback on Failure

By default if a CloudFormation stack fails to deploy it will auto-rollback. In
essence, this will prevent you from logging into the instance to see why it
failed.

We want to disable rollback on failure.

1. Expand the _Advanced_ section

    ![CloudFormation Advanced](aws_cloud_formation_advanced.png)

2. Select __No__ for the "Rollback on failure" option.

    ![CloudFormation Rollback](aws_cloud_formation_rollback.png)

3. Deploy your stack!


---

# Accessing Your Server

On successful stack creation, select the __Outputs__ tab in the lower left.

![CloudFormation Outputs](aws_cloud_formation_outputs.png)

The SSH output provides the SSH connect string you can use in order to SSH into
the machine.

You will either need to run this command from the same directory that contains
your `TEAMNAME.pem` file, or you can modify the `-i TEAMNAME.pem` parameter to
provide an appropriate path to your `pem` file.

The URL output provides a link to access your deployment running in
production mode.

---

# Deleting Your Stack

When you are done with your instance delete your stack.

![CloudFormation Delete Stack](aws_cloud_formation_delete_stack.png)

__Be careful!__ While you will not be able to delete the stacks of other teams,
you are able to delete your teammates' stacks. Double check that you are
deleting the right stacks.

---

# Stack Helper Files

There are two files that you may want to add to your repository:

## .ec2_initialize

This script runs before `bundle install` is run on the application
server(s). It is useful if you need to install any packages (only use `sudo` if
necessary)

```bash
sudo yum install -y ImageMagick
```

## .rails_initialize

This script runs after `rake db:create db:migrate` is run on the application
server(s). One usefulness is to use it to pre-populate your database, i.e.:

```
rake db:seed
```


Both files described in more detail at:
[https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/utils/#running-your-own-instance-configuration](https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/utils/#running-your-own-instance-configuration)

See the Demo app files here:
[https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/demo](https://github.com/scalableinternetservices/demo)

---

# Failed Stacks

The launching of your stack can fail for a number of reasons:

* Application failed to launch (you do have automated testing configured,
  right?)
* Missing gem
* Missing gem dependency (package to install via `sudo yum install -y ...`)
* Stack creation Timeout

Assuming you disabled "Rollback on Failure" then you will be able to SSH into
the instance to see what went wrong.

---

# Finding the EC2 Instance

When a stack failure occurs, you will not receive an output containing the SSH
command(s). You will need to manually find the EC2 instance to log into.

1. Note the failed stack name. Let's assume it is `demo-bboe`
2. Browse to the EC2 console:
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1)
3. In the filter bar type in your stack name: `demo-bboe`.
4. Select the instance and hit the __Connect__ button to obtain the connect
string.

![EC2 Filter](aws_ec2_filter.png)

__Note__: If there are multiple results and you're not on a multi-machine stack

# Inspecting the Instances' Log Files

There are a few files of interest on the app server instances:

* /var/log/cfn_init-cmd.log
* /var/log/cfn_init.log
* /var/log/cloud-init.log
* /var/log/cloud-init-output.log **

Use _less_, _tail_, _cat_, or your other favorite program to inspect these logs
to check for failures.

** __cloud-init-output.log__ will most likely contain the errors you are
   looking for.
