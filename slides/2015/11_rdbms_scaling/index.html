# Today's Agenda

* TODO
* RDBMS

# TODO

* Write Tsung xml file containing a single-complete session
* Use XML file to establish a baseline load test
* Read chapter 4 in High Performance Browser Networking

---

# Motivation

You have your web application running on EC2. It is becoming increasingly
popular and performance is degrading.

> What do you do?

---

# Handling Concurrent Requests

You have deployed application servers that can serve many concurrent requests.

But as your site's popularity continues to grow that is not sufficient.

> What do you do?

![Concurrent Requests](server_process_pool.png)

---

# Vertical Scaling

You have increased your instance sizes and handled more load.

However, as the popularity continues to grow you are no longer able to continue
scaling vertically.

> What do you do?

![Vertical Scaling](vertical_scaling.png)

---

# Horizontal Scaling

You have introduced a load balancer that distributes traffic across a pool of
application servers.

Nevertheless, as the traffic continues to increase, additional horizontal
scaling of the application servers does not solve the problem.

> What do you do?

![Horizontal Scaling](load_balanced_topology.png)

---

# Caching

You have properly configured HTTP caching such that unnecessary requests never
happen.

You are also caching heavyweight database operations.

But it is still not enough to handle the increased load of your popular site.

> What do you do?

---

# SQL Structure and Query Optimization

You have reduced the number of queries your application servers makes to the
database.

You have used `EXPLAIN` to discover indexes to add, and to ensure your most
common SQL queries are as optimal as possible.

However, your database is still a bottleneck.

> What do you do?

---

# Database Vertical Scaling

> Is your database swapping (out of memory)?

Scale up the amount of memory.

> Is your database load too high?

Scale up the CPU.

> Are neither of those working?
> What do you do?

---

# Database Horizontal Scaling?

With application servers we are able to scale horizontally by adding additional
machines and introducing a load balancer to access them.

> Can we do the same with the database?

![Horizontal Database Idea](horizontal_database_idea.png)

---

# Non-trivial DB Horizontal Scaling

 > Can we horizontally scale the database by adding more database servers and
 > accessing them through a load balancer?

Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

Horizontal scaling works great for _stateless_ services. However, the database
contains the state of our application, thus is not trivial to horizontally
scale.

---

# Problem: R(X), W(X), R(X)

![Database Horizontal Scaling Problem](database_horizontal_scaling_problem.png)

---

# Scaling Relational Databases

In a future lecture we will discuss scaling the data layer using non-relational
databases (NoSQL).

Today we will discuss in what ways we __can__ horizontally scale a relational
database.

---

# Three Techniques

Each of the following techniques partitions RDBMS in a different way:

* Sharding
* Service Oriented Architectures (SOA)
* Separating Reads from Writes

---

# Sharding: Idea

Take a single database and split (__shard__) it up into multiple smaller
databases such that everything still works.

> How do we handle joins across sharded data?

---

# Sharding: Joins

Any particular database join connects a small part of your database. However,
transitively, database joins could connect everything together.

## E.g. Demo App

* Any comment is only related to its parent (if not top-level), its children
  (replies), and its submission.
* Submissions relate to each other through communities.
* Transitively, all of these relationships could be joined across.

---

# Sharding: Separating Data

![Sharding](sharding_app_server.png)

Sharding a database requires finding some partition of your data that ideally
produces unrelated (not joined across) _shards_.

Once separated (_sharded_), your application cannot utilize the database to
join across them.

If you need to perform operations across sharded data, you will need to do it
at the application level. Consider the performance trade-offs. Could you shard
another way?

---

# Sharding: Similar Data

Sharding involves splitting data of the same type (e.g., the rows of the
tables).

For instance if we wanted to shard our `Comments` table into two partitions, we
could store comments belonging to half the submissions in _shard1_, and
those belonging to the other half in _shard2_.

> What is not sharding?

Separating tables into their own databases is not sharding. While this approach
may work for some applications, the ability to join across tables is lost.

---

# Finding the Data

Assume we have sharded the data for our application. We need some sort of
mapping to determine where to find that data.

> How can we find what shard our data is on?

---

# Finding the Shard

## At the application server layer?

> How would we implement this?

## At the load balancer?

> How would we implement this?

## Across multiple load balancers?

> How would we implement this?

---

# At the App Server

![App Server Sharding](sharding_app_server.png)

Each application server contains a configuration that informs it of where each
database is (IP address, DNS name) and how to map data to the database.

The mapping can be arbitrarily complex.

The mapping itself may even be stored in a database.

---

# At the load balancer

The load balancer could be configured to route requests to the app servers that
are configured to _talk_ to the right database.

Such mappings are limited by knowledge that the database can inspect:

* Resource URI
* Headers
* Request Payload

![Load Balancer Sharding](sharding_load_balancer.png)

---

# Across Load Balancers

![Sharding Across Load Balancers](sharding_region.png)

Host names (DNS) can be configured to point to the correct load balancer for a
given request.

Examples:

* en.wikipedia.org vs. es.wikipedia.org (language based sharding)
* google.com vs. google.co.uk (location based sharding)
* na6.salesforce.com vs. naX.salesforce.com (customer based sharding)

__Note__: The above examples could involve only a single load balancer.

---

# Finding Data: Trade-offs

The approaches we just described are vary from providing more flexibility to
providing more scalability.

* App Server (most flexible)
* Load Balancer
* DNS (most scalable)

---

# Sharding and Growth

Ideally the number of your partitions increase as the usage of your application
increases.

Example:

If each customer's data can be partitioned from the others, then doubling the
number of customers doubles the number of shards.

---

# Real World Example

## Gmail

The data that represents my email conceptually requires no relation to the data
representing other people's email.

When a request arrives to gmail, they apply some mapping function to determine
which database the user's data is located on.

Should Google need to take down a database, they can relocate the sharded data
to another database, and update the mapping.

---

# Demo App Example

* Users can create and view communities.
* Users can create submissions in these communities.
* Each submission has a tree of comments.

> How can we shard this application?

---

# Sharding Demo App

## By User?

This would have difficulty as logged in users will want to see communities,
submissions, and comments made by other logged in users.

## By Submission?

This would make generating submission lists for a single community difficult.

## By Community?

Obtaining a community list may be tricky, but cleanly partitioning comments and
submissions by their community is mostly clean.

---

# Community Sharding

> How could we make community based sharding work?

We can use information in the url with any of the three load balancing
approaches.

* http://ucsb.demo.com (community sub-domain)
* http://demo.com/ucsb (community path)

Either the application server connects to the right database for the `ucsb`
community, or DNS/loadbalancer directs the request to an application server
that always talks to the `ucsb` containing database.

---

# Community Sharding Success

![Sharding Submission View](sharding_submission_view.png)
![Sharding New Submission View](sharding_new_submission_view.png)
![Sharding New Comment View](sharding_new_comment_view.png)

---

# Community Sharding Difficulty

![Sharding Global Submission View](sharding_index_view.png)

* The global list of submissions.
* List of submissions by user.
* List of comments by user.

> What can we do to resolve these issues?

---

# Solving Sharding Problems

* Modify the user interface such that the difficult to shard page does not
  exist.
    * Can you get by with only providing the list of communities?
* Alternatively periodically run an expensive background job keep a
  semi-up-to-date global submission list aggregating results from across
  databases.

---

# Sharding in Rails

Rails does not have built-in support for sharding. However, thanks to the
open-source community, there exists a great Rails sharding gem Octopus:

[https://github.com/tchandy/octopus](https://github.com/tchandy/octopus)

```ruby
class BrazilController < ActionController::Base
  around_filter :select_shard

  def select_shard(&amp;block)
    Octopus.using(:brazil, &amp;block)
  end
end
```

The above sends all actions to the Brazil controller to the `:brazil` shard.

---

# Sharding Trade-offs

## Strengths

* If you genuinely have zero relations across shard, this scaling path is very
  powerful.
* Sharding works best when partitions grow with usage.

## Weaknesses

* Sharding can inhibit feature development. That is your application may be
  perfectly shardable today, but future features may change that.
* Not easy to retroactively add sharding to an existing application.
* Transactions across shards do not exist.
* Consistent DB snapshots across shards do not exist.

---

# Service Oriented Architecture

_Sharding_ partitions data of the same type into separate, unrelated groups.

_Service Oriented Architectures_ (SOA) do something different. They partition
both the data and the code based on type and function.

Like sharding, no relations will cross these partitions.

---

# SOA Stack

![Service Oriented Architecture](soa_stack.png)

The primary concept behind SOA is having many focused mini-applications.

Each of these focused mini-applications is called a service.

When a front-end application server needs data to satisfy a request, instead of
speaking to a database, it will request data from the appropriate service.

---

# SOA Functions

![Service Oriented Architecture](soa_stack.png)

Each service is broken out by logical function. E.g.:

* Users service that handles authentication and authorization
* Billing service that handles credit cards and subscriptions
* Account subsystem that tracks invoices

---

# SOA Communications

![Service Oriented Architecture](soa_stack.png)

With _sharding_ the application server typically only talks to a single shard.

With _SOA_ the front-end application server may communicate with many distinct
services, and some of those services may talk to a handful of other services.

---

# Benefits of SOA

![Service Oriented Architecture](soa_stack.png)

With SOA the deployment of services is decoupled. That means that each can be
updated and scaled independently of the remainder of the system. This
decoupling can provide isolated outages (billing is down for 5 minutes).

Services lend themselves well to maintenance by a single development team thus
minimizing conflicts between teams that would otherwise collectively work on a
single monolithic application.

---

# SOA and the Demo App

> How could we divide the Demo App into services?

![Demo App](demo_submissions_index.png)

---

# SOA and the Demo App

1. Comments service can track comments and replies for each submission.
2. Submissions service can be responsible for all the links that are submitted.
3. Communities service can store the list of communities along with their
   creator.
4. Users service can manage the users in the system.

---

# Demo App SOA Code

## Before

```ruby
class CommunitiesController < ApplicationController
  def create
    if current_user.allowed_to_create_community?
      Community.create!(params)
      render :show and return
    end
    render :new
  end
end
```

---

# Demo App SOA Code

## After

```ruby
class CommunitiesController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = UsersService.get_user_from_session(cookie)
    if user.allowed_to_create_community?
      CommunitiesService.create_submission!(params['title'],
                                            params['community'],
                                            user_id)
      render :show and return
    end
    render :new
  end
end
```

---

# SOA Implementation

SOA is mostly implemented by JSON of HTTP. RESTful APIs are common.

> Why JSON/HTTP/REST?

It's very easy to do. In fact, rails makes you do work in order to __not__ have
a JSON API (assuming you are using `rails generate`).

JSON APIs over HTTP are easily discovered. This permits (but doesn't
necessitate) less documentation as the API may be intuitive enough to use
without knowing much more than the endpoints and their input.

Using JSON/HTTP permits a shared technology stack. Rails on the front-end
application servers, and Rails on the servers hosting the services.

---

# Alternatives to JSON/HTTP/Rest

The primary issue with JSON/HTTP/REST is performance.

For high-performance internal APIs there are a few excellent options:

* Google Protocol Buffers
* Apache Thrift (developed by Facebook)

High performance APIs often trade flexibility for performance. For instance
they may require strongly typed data and as a result require more
documentation.

# SOA at Amazon

Jeff Bezos (Amazon CEO) circa 2002 (according to Steve Yegge)

1. All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through
   service interfaces.
2. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
3. There will be no other form of inter-process communication allowed: no direct
   linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory
   model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via
   service interface calls over the network.
4. It doesn't matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom
   protocols -- doesn't matter. Bezos doesn't care.
5. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground
   up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be
   able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No
   exceptions.
6. Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.
7. Thank you; have a nice day!

# SOA Trade-offs

## Strengths

* Small encapsulated code-bases
* Scales well as application size scales
* Scales well as number of teams scale

## Weaknesses

* May not scale with the number of users (e.g., increased load to
  authentication service)
* Transactions across services do not exist
* Consistent DB snapshots across services do not exist

---

# Database Operations

![Graph of Database Reads and Writes](database_reads_writes.png)

This graph shows significantly more _reads_ than _writes_. This may be the case
for your application.

---

# Database Horizontal Scaling

![Database Master Follower](database_master_follower.png)

In general a relational database is hard to horizontally scale.

However, when limited to a read-only copies, databases are very easy to
horizontally scale.

* Set up separate machines to act as __read followers__
* Whenever any transaction commits to the _master_ database, send a copy to
  each _follower_ and apply it

__Note__: The term _follower_ more often appears as the term _slave_ in the
database context. However, I will try to exclusively use _follower_.

---

# Database Replication

![Database Master Follower](database_master_follower.png)

The sending of data from the master to its followers (replication) can happen
either synchronously or asynchronously.

## Synchronous

When a transaction is committed to mater, the master sends the transaction to
its followers and waits until applied by all before completing.

## Asynchronous

When a transaction is committed to master, the master sends the transaction to
its followers but does not wait to see if the transaction is applied.


> What are the trade-offs?

---

# Database Replication Trade-offs

![Database Master Follower](database_master_follower.png)

> What are the advantages of waiting until it is applied to all followers?

Consistency. Subsequent read requests will see changes.

> What are the disadvantages of waiting until it is applied to all followers?

Performance. There may be many read followers to apply changes to.

---

# Database Replication Levels

![Database Master Follower](database_master_follower.png)

## Statement-level

Similar to streaming the journal from the master to its followers.

## Block-level

Instead of sending the SQL statements to the followers, send the consequences
of those statements.

> What are the advantages of each?

---

# Database Statement-level Replication

Statement-level is faster than block-level, with a catch.

An SQL statement is generally more compact than its consequences.

```sql
UPDATE txns SET amount=5;
```

The above query acts on all rows which may require a lot of data to transmit
the consequences.

However, SQL statements must now be deterministic:

```sql
UPDATE txns SET amount=5, updated_at=NOW();
```

> What is the value of `NOW()`?

Such values must be communicated from the master to its followers.

---

# Demo App and Read Followers

The following pages would be served from read followers:

![Global Submission View](small_demo_index_view.png)
![Submissions View](sharding_submission_view.png)

---

# Demo App DB Master Pages

The controllers associated with the following pages would need to talk to the
master database.

![Demo New Submission View](demo_half_new_submission_view.png)
![Demo New Comment View](demo_half_new_comment_view.png)

---

# Rails Read Follower Support

Like with sharding, rails does not provide build-in support.

However, the Octopus gem does support read followers:

```ruby
Octopus.using(:read_follower) do
  num_users = User.count
end

Octopus.using(:master) do
  User.create(:name => "Mike")
end
```

---

# Trade-offs of Read Followers

## Strengths

For applications with a high read-to-write ratio:

* the load on the master database can be dramatically reduced.
* read followers can be horizontally scaled (even with a load balancer)

## Weaknesses

Application developer needs to think about reads that affect writes vs. reads
that do not affect writes as such dependent reads should occur in the same
transaction as the write.

---

# At AppFolio

## High usage of sharding

* Each customer's data is stored in separate logical database.
* Those logical databases can be moved between distinct physical database
  servers as needed.

## Medium use of SOA

* Some functionality broken out into services, but the primary benefit is for
  scaling engineers than scaling load.


## Low use of Read vs. Write distinction

* We utilize read followers for backup and offline analysis.

---

# Summary

Horizontal scaling of relational databases is hard.

There is no silver bullet, but by combining sharding, SOA and read followers
you can get very far.

For applications that need to scale writes beyond what RDBMS can offer, you
need non-relational databases.
